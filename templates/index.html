<h2>Welcome to the Virtual ICWSM 2021</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
    <p>The conference comprises the following elements:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Format</dt>
      <dd>Pre-recorded talks are available to view at your convenience on this website. 
      During the live sessions, presentations have been assigned a one-hour slot
      during which we ask at least one author to be available to interact
      synchronously with participants on gathertown . (think of it like a virtual conference poster session where authors can interact with participants).  
      </dd>
      <dd>
        There are two ways of enjoying the conference this year: 
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <strong>ICWSM Lite - The MiniConf and Slack experience.</strong> Similar to last yearâ€™s ICWSM,
        participants can choose a largely solo journey through the talks and
        events in ICWSM but still meet up with others through Slack and the
        Single-track events. Limited opportunities to interact with paper
        authors, but you can always invite them to catch up on Slack!
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <strong>ICWSM Deluxe - The Gathertown, MiniConf, and Slack experience.</strong> Enrich
        your conference experience by hanging out in a custom-designed green
        space, much like your favorite spot on campus. Walk to your next session
        with your friends. Ask questions of the authors of the papers you really
        dig. Bump into the keynote speakers on your way to the next session.
        Hang out with the organising committee and ask all your burning
        questions. And when the sessions are over, unwind with new friends over
        a game of scribbl.
