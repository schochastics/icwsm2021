    short: "ICWSM is an international and diverse community. As we seek to grow and mature further, it is important to reflect on where we are now and whether there are opportunities to improve our global equity and diversity efforts. This panel brings together a series of experts within, and outside of, the core ICWSM community to critically reflect on the first 15 years of ICWSM, and how diverse and inclusive the conference has been. With this basis we then discuss how ICWSM can develop in these areas in the future, including identifying key steps to facilitate this global growth. If you cannot attend the panel in person, please submit your questions at the above-provided link. A recording of the panel will be made available for later viewing."
