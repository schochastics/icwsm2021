        embedded video to view the talk, slack channel for asynchronous
        discussion, and a calendar link."
      - Question: How can I best plan my time and engage with the conference?
        Answer: "Before the conference, browse this site and you can already
        watch some of the videos of interest. Our visualization with papers with
        similar content can help you to navigate all papers or find more
        interesting papers. Additionally or alternatively, you can walk around
        in the virtual space and find the content you are most interested in/"

        apart and authors of papers can choose the most convenient time to be
        present for Q&A."
