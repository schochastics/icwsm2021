  - Section: Getting Started
    QA:
      - Question: How should I navigate this site?
        Answer: "Visit the Schedule and Papers pages. 
        Each paper has its landing page with a link to the pdf, abstract,
        embedded video to view the talk, slack channel for asynchronous
        discussion, and a calendar link. During the session, you can also hop
        directly into the virtual room on gather.town to view the video and
        potentially meet the author"
      - Question: How can I best plan my time and engage with the conference?
        Answer: "Before the conference, browse this site and you can already
        watch some of the videos of interest. Our visualization with papers with
        similar content can help you to navigate all papers or find more
        interesting papers. Additionally or alternatively, you can walk around
        in the virtual space and find the content you are most interested in. 
        During the conference, we recommend to engage via the virtual space on
        gather town to maximize your conference experience."
      - Question: How can I best engage from my timezone?
        Answer: "We have tried to spread sessions across different time zones,
        but it is difficult to accommodate all times. Live content is repeated
        roughly 12h apart and all videos can be watched on demand, either on
        this site or the gather town space."
      - Question: What if I have a problem?
        Answer: "If you have any technical difficulties, please contact
        #01-helpdesk on slack. If you have any problems with accessing gather
        town, please contact help+icwsm-2021@virtualchair.net or check
        https://www.virtualchair.net/guide for help. If you have a problem with
        inappropriate conduct, please refer to the Code of Conduct."
      - Question: What tools and logins do I need?
        Answer: "The only account you need to create is for slack . You should have received
        an invitation to join the Slack workspace (icwsm2021.slack.com). 
        For the gather.town, you can login with the email address you used for registration."
      - Question: How can I find other people to chat with during the conference?
        Answer: "Participants are encouraged to interact and discuss with others
        on gather town in the designated spots (e.g. the Poster rooms or the garden). Alternatively, participants can
        also chat on slack in dedicated channels.
        Please be advised to be careful about harassment and follow the Code of Conduct"
        
  - Section: Live Interaction
    QA:
      - Question: What parts of ICWSM are live?
        Answer: "Panels and Keynote are live. The recording is available
        afterwards on demand. Presentations for papers are recorded but for each
        paper, there is a 3 minute Q&A session on gather town. Presenters are
        also encouraged to be available for questions next to their poster 15 minutes after the
        session"
      - Question: How do I talk to an author at a poster?
        Answer: "There is a 3 minute Q&A session after each presentation and
        authors are encouraged to stay at their poster after the session for 15
        minutes. You can also talk to authors if you 'bump' into them in the
        virtual space."
      - Question: How do I ask questions of the panel speakers, offline before their live Q&A?
        Answer: "You can submit your question before for any panel here: http://bit.ly/ICWSM2021-panels"

        Answer: ""
      - Question: Can I ask questions of the invited speakers live on Zoom?
        Answer: ""
      - Question: Why are recorded presentations so short?
        Answer: "We have opted for shorter recordings based on feedback from
        previous participants, one-on-one discussions with attendees, and in
        particular, to allow for a shorter and more agile virtual conference
        programme. We believe that these shorter sessions allow more time for
        live interactions and discussion."
      - Question: What are spotlight papers?
        Answer: "Spotlight papers, or papers in the two spotlight sessions, are
        the top scoring papers at this year’s conference. Spotlight sessions are
        single track, and it is from these papers that the best paper has been
        selected."
