7274,Characterising User Content on a Multi-Lingual Social Network,Pushkal Agarwal|Kiran Garimella|Sagar Joglekar|Nishanth Sastry|Gareth Tyson,"Social media has been on the vanguard of political information diffusion in the 21st century. Most studies that look into disinformation, political influence and fake-news focus on mainstream social media platforms. This has inevitably made English an important factor in our current understanding of political activity on social media. As a result, there has only been a limited number of studies into a large portion of the world, including the largest, multilingual and multicultural democracy: India. In this paper we present our characterisation of a multilingual social network in India called ShareChat. We collect an exhaustive dataset across 72 weeks before and during the Indian general elections of 2019, across 14 languages. We investigate the cross lingual dynamics by clustering visually similar images together, and exploring how they move across language barriers. We find that Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada languages tend to be dominant in soliciting political images (often referred to as memes), and posts from Hindi have the largest cross-lingual diffusion across ShareChat (as well as images containing text in English). In the case of images containing text that cross language barriers, we see that language translation is used to widen the accessibility. That said, we find cases where the same image is associated with very different text (and therefore meanings). This initial characterisation paves the way for more advanced pipelines to understand the dynamics of fake and political content in a multi-lingual and non-textual setting.",P6,P6
7275,Communal Quirks and Circlejerks: A Taxonomy of Processes Contributing to Insularity in Online Communities,Kimberley Allison|Kay Bussey,"Online communication offers the potential for bridging con-nections, exposing users to new views and experiences by fostering socially heterogenous communities. However, in the absence of deliberate attempts to promote diversity, communities may tend towards insularity: a state where members and content are similar or homogenous, and where deviation from these norms is discouraged. This paper presents a taxonomy of processes contributing to insularity, synthesizing findings from a broader longitudinal interview study on engagement with online communities over time with previous literature. Using thematic analysis, sixteen processes were identified which were associated with four broad stages: formation (selective connections, network homophily, shared interests, audience segmentation); propagation (circlejerking, upholding community standards, avoiding conflict, tailoring content); reaction (individual avoidance, collective reaction, mocking deviance, derogating outsiders); and perpetuation (modelling, prior feedback, echo chambers, gatekeeping). These findings highlight the need to consider more diverse mechanisms by which communities become insular, and the role that platform features play in facilitating these processes.",P9,P9
7276,Auditing Race and Gender Discrimination in Online Housing Markets,Joshua Asplund|Motahhare Eslami|Hari Sundaram|Christian Sandvig|Karrie Karahalios,"While researchers have developed rigorous practices for offline housing audits to enforce the US Fair Housing Act, the online world lacks similar practices. In this work we lay out principles for developing and performing online fairness audits. We demonstrate a controlled sock-puppet audit technique for building online profiles associated with a specific demographic profile or intersection of profiles, and describe the requirements to train and verify profiles of other demographics. We also present two audits using these sock-puppet profiles. The first audit explores the number and content of housing-related ads served to a user. The second compares the ordering of personalized recommendations on major housing and real-estate sites. We examine whether the results of each of these audits exhibit indirect discrimination: whether there is correlation between the content served and users' protected features, even if the system does not know or use these features explicitly. Our results show differential treatment in the number and type of housing ads served based on the user's race, as well as bias in property recommendations based on the user's gender. We believe this framework provides a compelling foundation for further exploration of housing fairness online.",P10,P10
7277,Auditing News Curation Systems: A Case Study Examining Algorithmic and Editorial Logic in Apple News,Jack Bandy|Nicholas Diakopoulos,"This work presents an audit study of Apple News as a sociotechnical news curation system that exercises gatekeeping power in the media. We examine the mechanisms behind Apple News as well as the content presented in the app, outlining the social, political, and economic implications of both aspects. We focus on the Trending Stories section, which is algorithmically curated, and the Top Stories section, which is human-curated. Results from a crowdsourced audit showed minimal content personalization in the Trending Stories section, and a sock-puppet audit showed no location-based content adaptation. Finally, we perform an extended two-month data collection to compare the human-curated Top Stories section with the algorithmically-curated Trending Stories section. Within these two sections, human curation outperformed algorithmic curation in several measures of source diversity, concentration, and evenness. Furthermore, algorithmic curation featured more “soft news” about celebrities and entertainment, while editorial curation featured more news about policy and international events. To our knowledge, this study provides the first data-backed characterization of Apple News in the United States.",S2,S2
7278,Higher Ground? How Groundtruth Labeling Impacts Our Understanding of Fake News about the 2016 U.S. Presidential Nominees,Lia Bozarth|Aparajita Saraf|Ceren Budak,"The spread of fake news on social media platforms has garnered much public attention and apprehension. Consequently, both the tech industry and academia alike are investing increased effort to understand, detect, and curb fake news. Yet, researchers differ in what they consider to be fake news sites. In this paper, we first aggregate 5 lists of fake and 3 of mainstream news sites published by experts and reputable organizations. Then, focusing on tweets about the democratic (Hillary Clinton) and republican (Donald Trump) nominees in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we use each pair of fake and traditional news lists as an independent “groundtruth” to examine i) the prevalence, ii) temporal characteristics and iii) the agenda-setting differences between fake and traditional news sites. We observe that depending on the groundtruth, the prevalence of fake news varies significantly. However, the temporal trends and agenda-setting differences between fake and mainstream news sites remain moderately consistent across different groundtruth lists.",P6,P6
7279,Toward a Better Performance Evaluation Framework for Fake News Classification,Lia Bozarth|Ceren Budak,"The rising prevalence of fake news and its alarming downstream impact have motivated both the industry and academia to build a substantial number of fake news classification models, each with its unique architecture. Yet, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive model evaluation framework that can provide multifaceted comparisons between these models beyond the simple evaluation metrics such as accuracy or f1 scores. In our work, we examine a representative subset of classifiers using a very simple set of performance evaluation and error analysis steps. We demonstrate that model performance varies considerably based on i) dataset, ii) evaluation archetype, and iii) performance metrics. Additionally, classifiers also demonstrate a potential bias against small and conservative-leaning credible news sites. Finally, models' performance varies based on external events and article topics. In sum, our results highlight the need to move toward systematic benchmarking.",P5,P5
7280,Learning Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings from Twitter via Distant Supervision,Jose Camacho-Collados|Yerai Doval|Eugenio Martínez-Cámara|Luis Espinosa-Anke|Francesco Barbieri|Steven Schockaert,"Cross-lingual embeddings represent the meaning of words from different languages in the same vector space. Recent work has shown that it is possible to construct such representations by aligning independently learned monolingual embedding spaces, and that accurate alignments can be obtained even without external bilingual data. In this paper we explore a research direction that has been surprisingly neglected in the literature: leveraging noisy user-generated text to learn cross-lingual embeddings particularly tailored towards social media applications. While the noisiness and informal nature of the social media genre poses additional challenges to cross-lingual embedding methods, we find that it also provides key opportunities due to the abundance of code-switching and the existence of a shared vocabulary of emoji and named entities. Our contribution consists of a very simple post-processing step that exploits these phenomena to significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art alignment methods.",P5,P5
7281,When Your Friends Become Sellers: An Empirical Study of Social Commerce Site Beidian,Hancheng Cao|Zhilong Chen|Fengli Xu|Tao Wang|Yujian Xu|Lianglun Zhang|Yong Li,"Past few years have witnessed the emergence and phenomenal success of strong-tie based social commerce. Embedded in social networking sites, these E-Commerce platforms transform ordinary people into sellers, where they advertise and sell products to their friends and family in online social networks. These sites can acquire millions of users within a short time, and are growing fast at an accelerated rate. However, little is known about how these social commerce develop as a blend of social relationship and economic transactions. In this paper we present the first measurement study on the full-scale data of Beidian, one of the fastest growing social commerce sites in China, which involves 11.8 million users. We first analyzed the topological structure of the Beidian platform and highlighted its decentralized nature. We then studied the site's rapid growth and its growth mechanism via invitation cascade. Finally, we investigated purchasing behavior on Beidian, where we focused on user proximity and loyalty, which contributes to the site's high conversion rate. As the consequences of interactions between strong ties and economic logics, emerging social commerce demonstrates significant property deviations from all known social networks and E-Commerce in terms of network structure, dynamics and user behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first quantitative study on the network characteristics and dynamics of emerging social commerce platforms.",P6,P6
7282,Feature-Based Explanations Don't Help People Detect Misclassifications of Online Toxicity,Samuel Carton|Qiaozhu Mei|Paul Resnick,"We present an experimental assessment of the impact of feature attribution-style explanations on human performance in predicting the consensus toxicity of social media posts with advice from an unreliable machine learning model. By doing so we add to a small but growing body of literature inspecting the utility of interpretable machine learning in terms of human outcomes. We also evaluate interpretable machine learning for the first time in the important domain of online toxicity, where fully-automated methods have faced criticism as being inadequate as a measure of toxic behavior.",P2,P2
7283,Generating Realistic Interest-Driven Information Cascades,Federico Cinus|Francesco Bonchi|Corrado Monti|André Panisson,"We propose a model for the synthetic generation of information cascades in social media. In our model the information “memes” propagating in the social network are characterized by a probability distribution in a topic space, accompanied by a textual description, i.e., a bag of keywords coherent with the topic distribution. Similarly, every user of the social media is described by a vector of interests defined over the same topic space. Information cascades are governed by the topic of the meme, its level of virality, the interests of each user, community pressure, and social influence.",P8,P8
7284,Generalized Euclidean Measure to Estimate Network Distances,Michele Coscia,"Estimating the distance covered by a propagation phenomenon on a network is an important task: it can help us estimating the infectiousness of a disease or the effectiveness of an online viral marketing campaign. However, so far the only way to make such an estimate relies on solving the optimal transportation problem, or by adapting graph signal processing techniques. Such solutions are either inefficient, because they require solving a complex optimization problem; or fragile, because they were not designed with this problem in mind. In this paper, we propose a new generalized Euclidean approach to estimate distances between weighted groups of nodes in a network. We do so by adapting the Mahalanobis distance, incorporating the graph's topology via the pseudoinverse of its Laplacian. In experiments we see that this measure returns intuitive distances which agree with the ones a human would estimate. We also show that the measure is able to recover the infection parameter in an epidemic model, or the activation threshold in a cascade model. We conclude by showing that the measure can be used in online social media settings to identify fast-spreading behaviors. Our measure is also less computationally expensive.",P9,P9
7285,Falling into the Echo Chamber: The Italian Vaccination Debate on Twitter,Alessandro Cossard|Gianmarco De Francisci Morales|Kyriaki Kalimeri|Yelena Mejova|Daniela Paolotti|Michele Starnini,"The reappearance of measles in the US and Europe, a disease considered eliminated in early 2000s, has been accompanied by a growing debate on the merits of vaccination on social media. In this study we examine the extent to which the vaccination debate on Twitter is conductive to potential outreach to the vaccination hesitant. We focus on Italy, one of the countries most affected by the latest measles outbreaks. We discover that the vaccination skeptics, as well as the advocates, reside in their own distinct “echo chambers”. The structure of these communities differs as well, with skeptics arranged in a tightly connected cluster, and advocates organizing themselves around few authoritative hubs. At the center of these echo chambers we find the ardent supporters, for which we build highly accurate network- and content-based classifiers (attaining 95% cross-validated accuracy). Insights of this study provide several avenues for potential future interventions, including network-guided targeting, accounting for the political context, and monitoring of alternative sources of information.",P5,P5
7286,Unsupervised User Stance Detection on Twitter,Kareem Darwish|Peter Stefanov|Michaël Aupetit|Preslav Nakov,"We present a highly effective unsupervised framework for detecting the stance of prolific Twitter users with respect to controversial topics. In particular, we use dimensionality reduction to project users onto a low-dimensional space, followed by clustering, which allows us to find core users that are representative of the different stances. Our framework has three major advantages over pre-existing methods, which are based on supervised or semi-supervised classification. First, we do not require any prior labeling of users: instead, we create clusters, which are much easier to label manually afterwards, e.g., in a matter of seconds or minutes instead of hours. Second, there is no need for domain- or topic-level knowledge either to specify the relevant stances (labels) or to conduct the actual labeling. Third, our framework is robust in the face of data skewness, e.g., when some users or some stances have greater representation in the data. We experiment with different combinations of user similarity features, dataset sizes, dimensionality reduction methods, and clustering algorithms to ascertain the most effective and most computationally efficient combinations across three different datasets (in English and Turkish). We further verified our results on additional tweet sets covering six different controversial topics. Our best combination in terms of effectiveness and efficiency uses retweeted accounts as features, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and Mean Shift for clustering, and yields a small number of high-quality user clusters, typically just 2–3, with more than 98% purity. The resulting user clusters can be used to train downstream classifiers. Moreover, our framework is robust to variations in the hyper-parameter values and also with respect to random initialization.",P9,P9
7287,Understanding Visual Memes: An Empirical Analysis of Text Superimposed on Memes Shared on Twitter,Yuhao Du|Muhammad Aamir Masood|Kenneth Joseph,"Visual memes have become an important mechanism through which ideologically potent and hateful content spreads on today's social media platforms. At the same time, they are also a mechanism through which we convey much more mundane things, like pictures of cats with strange accents. Little is known, however, about the relative percentage of visual memes shared by real people that fall into these, or other, thematic categories. The present work focuses on visual memes that contain superimposed text. We carry out the first large-scale study on the themes contained in the text of these memes, which we refer to as image-with-text memes. We find that 30% of the image-with-text memes in our sample which have identifiable themes are politically relevant, and that these politically relevant memes are shared more often by Democrats than Republicans. We also find disparities in who expresses themselves via image-with-text memes, and images in general, versus other forms of expression on Twitter. The fact that some individuals use images with text to express themselves, instead of sending a plain text tweet, suggests potential consequences for the representativeness of analyses that ignore text contained in images.",P6,P6
7288,The Effect of Homophily on Disparate Visibility of Minorities in People Recommender Systems,Francesco Fabbri|Francesco Bonchi|Ludovico Boratto|Carlos Castillo,"Evaluating (and mitigating) the potential negative effects of algorithms has become a central issue in computer science. While research on algorithmic bias in ranking systems has dealt with disparate exposure of products or individuals, less attention has been devoted to the analysis of the disparate exposure of subgroups of online users.",P5,P5
7289,Minimizing Interference and Selection Bias in Network Experiment Design,Zahra Fatemi|Elena Zheleva,"Current approaches to A/B testing in networks focus on limiting interference, the concern that treatment effects can ""spill over"" from treatment nodes to control nodes and lead to biased causal effect estimation. Prominent methods for network experiment design rely on two-stage randomization, in which sparsely-connected clusters are identified and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control. Here, we show that cluster randomization does not ensure sufficient node randomization and it can lead to selection bias in which treatment and control nodes represent different populations of users. To address this problem, we propose a principled framework for network experiment design which jointly minimizes interference and selection bias. We introduce the concepts of edge spillover probability and cluster matching and demonstrate their importance for designing network A/B testing. Our experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that our proposed framework leads to significantly lower error in causal effect estimation than existing solutions.",P8,P8
7290,"No Robots, Spiders, or Scrapers: Legal and Ethical Regulation of Data Collection Methods in Social Media Terms of Service",Casey Fiesler|Nathan Beard|Brian C. Keegan,"Researchers from many different disciplines rely on social media data as a resource. Whereas some platforms explicitly allow data collection, even facilitating it through an API, others explicitly forbid automated or manual collection processes. A current topic of debate within the social computing research community involves the ethical (or even legal) implications of collecting data in ways that violate Terms of Service (TOS). Using a sample of TOS from over one hundred social media sites from around the world, we analyze TOS language and content in order to better understand the landscape of prohibitions on this practice. Our findings show that though these provisions are very common, they are also ambiguous, inconsistent, and lack context. By considering our analysis of the nature of these provisions alongside legal and ethical analysis, we propose that ethical decision-making for data collection should extend beyond TOS and consider contextual factors of the data source and research.",P9,P9
7291,Confidence Boost in Dyadic Online Teamwork: An Individual-Focused Perspective,Liye Fu|Andrew Z. Wang|Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,"Individuals are often more confident in their solutions when working in teams than when working on their own. This confidence boost is observed even when it is not accompanied by a corresponding gain in performance, raising the question of what other factors might be responsible. We address this question by developing a large-scale experimental setting in the form of a two-player online game that allows us to track the confidence of individuals in naturally-occurring online collaborative tasks. This setting enables us to disentangle and compare the effects of different components of the collaborative process on the confidence of each team member. We show that confidence evaluations are subject to social influence: a low-confidence individual receives a confidence boost as a direct consequence of interacting with their teammate, and the extent of the increase depends more on the confidence, rather than on the competence, of the teammate. The resulting framework can enhance our understanding of confidence boost as an often overlooked byproduct of online teamwork and has implications for designing better online collaboration platforms to meet diverse collaborative objectives.",P7,P7
7292,#MeTooMA: Multi-Aspect Annotations of Tweets Related to the MeToo Movement,Akash Gautam|Puneet Mathur|Rakesh Gosangi|Debanjan Mahata|Ramit Sawhney|Rajiv Ratn Shah,"In this paper, we present a dataset containing 9,973 tweets related to the MeToo movement that were manually annotated for five different linguistic aspects: relevance, stance, hate speech, sarcasm, and dialogue acts. We present a detailed account of the data collection and annotation processes. The annotations have a very high inter-annotator agreement (0.79 to 0.93 k-alpha) due to the domain expertise of the annotators and clear annotation instructions. We analyze the data in terms of geographical distribution, label correlations, and keywords. Lastly, we present some potential use cases of this dataset. We expect this dataset would be of great interest to psycholinguists, socio-linguists, and computational linguists to study the discursive space of digitally mobilized social movements on sensitive issues like sexual harassment.",P8,P8
7293,REST: A Thread Embedding Approach for Identifying and Classifying User-Specified Information in Security Forums,Joobin Gharibshah|Evangelos E. Papalexakis|Michalis Faloutsos,"How can we extract useful information from a security forum? We focus on identifying threads of interest to a security professional: (a) alerts of worrisome events, such as attacks, (b) offering of malicious services and products, (c) hacking information to perform malicious acts, and (d) useful security-related experiences. The analysis of security forums is in its infancy despite several promising recent works. Novel approaches are needed to address the challenges in this domain: (a) the difficulty in specifying the “topics” of interest efficiently, and (b) the unstructured and informal nature of the text. We propose, REST, a systematic methodology to: (a) identify threads of interest based on a, possibly incomplete, bag of words, and (b) classify them into one of the four classes above. The key novelty of the work is a multi-step weighted embedding approach: we project words, threads and classes in appropriate embedding spaces and establish relevance and similarity there. We evaluate our method with real data from three security forums with a total of 164k posts and 21K threads. First, REST robustness to initial keyword selection can extend the user-provided keyword set and thus, it can recover from missing keywords. Second, REST categorizes the threads into the classes of interest with superior accuracy compared to five other methods: REST exhibits an accuracy between 63.3-76.9%. We see our approach as a first step for harnessing the wealth of information of online forums in a user-friendly way, since the user can loosely specify her keywords of interest.",S1,S1
7294,Towards Quantifying the Distance between Opinions,Saket Gurukar|Deepak Ajwani|Sourav Dutta|Juho Lauri|Srinivasan Parthasarathy|Alessandra Sala,"Increasingly, critical decisions in public policy, governance, and business strategy rely on a deeper understanding of the needs and opinions of constituent members (e.g. citizens, shareholders). While it has become easier to collect a large number of opinions on a topic, there is a necessity for automated tools to help navigate the space of opinions. In such contexts understanding and quantifying the similarity between opinions is key. We find that measures based solely on text similarity or on overall sentiment often fail to effectively capture the distance between opinions. Thus, we propose a new distance measure for capturing the similarity between opinions that leverages the nuanced observation – similar opinions express similar sentiment polarity on specific relevant entities-of-interest. Specifically, in an unsupervised setting, our distance measure achieves significantly better Adjusted Rand Index scores (up to 56x) and Silhouette coefficients (up to 21x) compared to existing approaches. Similarly, in a supervised setting, our opinion distance measure achieves considerably better accuracy (up to 20% increase) compared to extant approaches that rely on text similarity, stance similarity, and sentiment similarity.",P7,P7
7295,Learn2Link: Linking the Social and Academic Profiles of Researchers,Asmelash Teka Hadgu|Jayanth Kumar Reddy Gundam,"People have presence across different information networks on the social web. The problem of user identity linking, is the task of establishing a connection between accounts of the same user across different networks. Solving this problem is useful for: personalized recommendations, cross platform data enrichment and verifying online information among others. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach that jointly models heterogeneous data: text content, network structure as well as profile names and images, in order to solve the user identity linking problem. We perform experiments on a real world problem of connecting the social profile (Twitter) and academic profile (DBLP) of researchers. Experimental results show that our joint model achieves a 97% F1 score outperforming state-of-the-art results that consider profile, content or network features only.",P8,P8
7296,Towards Automated Sexual Violence Report Tracking,Naeemul Hassan|Amrit Poudel|Jason Hale|Claire Hubacek|Khandaker Tasnim Huq|Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu|Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,"Warning: This paper may contain trigger words that might be uncomfortable to some readers. Tracking sexual violence is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a supervised learning-based automated sexual violence report tracking model that is more scalable, and reliable than its crowdsource based counterparts. We define the sexual violence report tracking problem by considering victim, perpetrator contexts and the nature of the violence. We find that our model could identify sexual violence reports with a precision and recall of 80.4% and 83.4%, respectively. Moreover, we also applied the model during and after the #MeToo movement. Several interesting findings are discovered which are not easily identifiable from a shallow analysis.",P2,P2
7297,Two Computational Models for Analyzing Political Attention in Social Media,Libby Hemphill|Angela M. Schöpke-Gonzalez,"Understanding how political attention is divided and over what subjects is crucial for research on areas such as agenda setting, framing, and political rhetoric. Existing methods for measuring attention, such as manual labeling according to established codebooks, are expensive and can be restrictive. We describe two computational models that automatically distinguish topics in politicians' social media content. Our models—one supervised classifier and one unsupervised topic model—provide different benefits. The supervised classifier reduces the labor required to classify content according to pre-determined topic list. However, tweets do more than communicate policy positions. Our unsupervised model uncovers both political topics and other Twitter uses (e.g., constituent service). These models are effective, inexpensive computational tools for political communication and social media research. We demonstrate their utility and discuss the different analyses they afford by applying both models to the tweets posted by members of the 115th U.S. Congress.",P5,P5
7298,Towards Measuring Adversarial Twitter Interactions against Candidates in the US Midterm Elections,Yiqing Hua|Thomas Ristenpart|Mor Naaman,"Adversarial interactions against politicians on social media such as Twitter have significant impact on society. In particular they disrupt substantive political discussions online, and may discourage people from seeking public office. In this study, we measure the adversarial interactions against candidates for the US House of Representatives during the run-up to the 2018 US general election. We gather a new dataset consisting of 1.7 million tweets involving candidates, one of the largest corpora focusing on political discourse. We then develop a new technique for detecting tweets with toxic content that are directed at any specific candidate. Such technique allows us to more accurately quantify adversarial interactions towards political candidates. Further, we introduce an algorithm to induce candidate-specific adversarial terms to capture more nuanced adversarial interactions that previous techniques may not consider toxic. Finally, we use these techniques to outline the breadth of adversarial interactions seen in the election, including offensive name-calling, threats of violence, posting discrediting information, attacks on identity, and adversarial message repetition.",P3,P3
7299,When Does Trust in Online Social Groups Grow?,Shankar Iyer|Justin Cheng|Nick Brown|Xiuhua Wang,"The trust that people feel in their social groups is linked to important social outcomes such as member satisfaction and collective task performance. To understand the behaviors and conditions linked to trust, past studies of trust in groups have typically relied on cross-sectional surveys, but these are limited in their ability to identify causation. To better test the potential causal pathways between trust and behaviors or group properties, we paired a two-wave longitudinal survey of 2358 participants in Facebook Groups with logged activity on Facebook. Using latent change score modeling, we examined how trust may predict changes in behavior or group properties and how behaviors and group properties may predict changes in trust. On one hand, people who trust a group tend to contribute more written content to the group over time; and while groups that are more trusted tend to add more administrators and moderators over time, groups that have many administrators and moderators does not tend to be trusted more over time. On the other hand, people's trust in a group increases over time when the group is well-connected and active overall, while that trust decreases over time when that person is also actively involved in multiple other groups. These findings suggest a positive feedback loop related to active engagement and trust: seeing activity in a group drives trust, which in turn leads to increased individual activity and hence greater overall activity in the group. Overall, trust may be best promoted by encouraging both active engagement and friendship formation.",P2,P2
7300,Beyond Positive Emotion: Deconstructing Happy Moments Based on Writing Prompts,Kokil Jaidka|Niyati Chhaya|Saran Mumick|Matthew Killingsworth|Alon Halevy|Lyle Ungar,"This study reports experiments with the newly-released CL-Aff HappyDB dataset, which looks beyond positive emotion in modeling descriptions of happy moments collected through writing prompts. The widespread adoption of social media has improved researchers' access to unsolicited expressions and behaviors. However, most of the approaches to analyzing these expressions involve a keyword search and focuses on predicting sentiment or emotional content rather than understanding a deeper psychological state, such as happiness. The CL-Aff HappyDB dataset is the first effort to distinguish the personal agency and social interaction in writings about happiness, which do not yet have an exact equivalent concept in existing text-based approaches. We report that state of the art approaches for emotion detection have different topical characteristics, and do not generalize well to detect happiness in the CL-Aff HappyDB dataset. Language models trained on the dataset, on the other hand, generalize to social media writing and are a valid approach for downstream tasks, such as predicting life satisfaction from social media posts.",P4,P4
7301,Identifying and Quantifying Coordinated Manipulation of Upvotes and Downvotes in Naver News Comments,Jiwan Jeong|Jeong-han Kang|Sue Moon,"Today, many news sites let users write comments on news articles, rate others' comments by upvoting and downvoting, and order the comments by the rating. Top-rated comments are placed right below the news article and read widely, reaching a large audience and wielding great influence. As their importance grew, upvotes and downvotes are increasingly manipulated by coordinated efforts to hide existing top comments and push certain comments to the top. In this paper, we analyze comment sections of articles targeted by coordinated efforts and identify a trace of vote manipulation. Based on the findings, we propose a parameterized classifier that distinguishes comment threads affected by coordinated voting. The classifier only uses the number of upvotes and downvotes of comments. Therefore it is widely applicable to general vote-based curation systems where contents are sorted by the difference of upvotes and downvotes. Using the classifier and our choice of parameters, we have examined six years of the entire commenting history on a leading news portal in South Korea. Manual inspection in partisan online communities could only identify a few hundreds of targeted articles. With our classifier, we have identified more than ten thousand comment threads with a high likelihood of manipulation. We also observe a significant increase in coordinated manipulation in recent years.",S1,S1
7302,Modeling and Measuring Expressed (Dis)belief in (Mis)information,Shan Jiang|Miriam Metzger|Andrew Flanagin|Christo Wilson,"The proliferation of online misinformation has been raising increasing societal concerns about its potential consequences, e.g., polarizing the public and eroding trust in institutions. These consequences are framed under the public's susceptibility to such misinformation — a narrative that needs further investigation and quantification. To this end, our paper proposes an observational approach to model and measure expressed (dis)beliefs in (mis)information by leveraging social media comments as a proxy. We collect a sample of tweets in response to (mis)information and annotate them with (dis)belief labels, explore the dataset using lexicon-based methods, and finally build classifiers based on the state-of-the-art neural transfer-learning models (BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa). Under a domain-specific thresholding strategy for unbiasedness, the best-performing classifier archives macro-F1 scores around 0.86 for disbelief and 0.80 for belief. Applying the classifier, we conduct a large-scale measurement study and show that, for true/mixed/false claims on social media, 12%/14%/15% of comments express disbelief and 26%/21%/20% of comments express belief. In addition, our results suggest an extremely slight time effect of falsehood awareness, a positive effect of fact-checks to false claims, and differences in (dis)belief across social media platforms.",S3,S3
7303,Behind the Mask: A Computational Study of Anonymous' Presence on Twitter,Keenan Jones|Jason R. C. Nurse|Shujun Li,"The hacktivist group Anonymous is unusual in its public-facing nature. Unlike other cybercriminal groups, which rely on secrecy and privacy for protection, Anonymous is prevalent on the social media site, Twitter. In this paper we re-examine some key findings reported in previous small-scale qualitative studies of the group using a large-scale computational analysis of Anonymous' presence on Twitter. We specifically refer to reports which reject the group's claims of leaderlessness, and indicate a fracturing of the group after the arrests of prominent members in 2011-2013. In our research, we present the first attempts to use machine learning to identify and analyse the presence of a network of over 20,000 Anonymous accounts spanning from 2008-2019 on the Twitter platform. In turn, this research utilises social network analysis (SNA) and centrality measures to examine the distribution of influence within this large network, identifying the presence of a small number of highly influential accounts. Moreover, we present the first study of tweets from some of the identified key influencer accounts and, through the use of topic modelling, demonstrate a similarity in overarching subjects of discussion between these prominent accounts. These findings provide robust, quantitative evidence to support the claims of smaller-scale, qualitative studies of the Anonymous collective.",P6,P6
7304,Leveraging Mobility Flows from Location Technology Platforms to Test Crime Pattern Theory in Large Cities,Cristina Kadar|Stefan Feuerriegel|Anastasios Noulas|Cecilia Mascolo,"Crime has been previously explained by social characteristics of the residential population and, as stipulated by crime pattern theory, might also be linked to human movements of non-residential visitors. Yet a full empirical validation of the latter is lacking. The prime reason is that prior studies are limited to aggregated statistics of human visitors rather than mobility flows and, because of that, neglect the temporal dynamics of individual human movements. As a remedy, we provide the first work which studies the ability of granular human mobility in describing and predicting crime concentrations at an hourly scale. For this purpose, we propose the use of data from location technology platforms. This type of data allows us to trace individual transitions and, therefore, we succeed in distinguishing different mobility flows that (i) are incoming or outgoing from a neighborhood, (ii) remain within it, or (iii) refer to transitions where people only pass through the neighborhood. Our evaluation infers mobility flows by leveraging an anonymized dataset from Foursquare that includes almost 14.8 million consecutive check-ins in three major U.S. cities. According to our empirical results, mobility flows are significantly and positively linked to crime. These findings advance our theoretical understanding, as they provide confirmatory evidence for crime pattern theory. Furthermore, our novel use of digital location services data proves to be an effective tool for crime forecasting. It also offers unprecedented granularity when studying the connection between human mobility and crime.",P2,P2
7305,Gossip and Attend: Context-Sensitive Graph Representation Learning,Zekarias Kefato|Sarunas Girdzijauskas,"Graph representation learning (GRL) is a powerful technique for learning low-dimensional vector representation of high-dimensional and often sparse graphs. Most studies explore the structure and metadata associated with the graph using random walks and employ an unsupervised or semi-supervised learning schemes. Learning in these methods is context-free, resulting in only a single representation per node. Recently studies have argued on the adequacy of a single representation and proposed context-sensitive approaches, which are capable of extracting multiple node representations for different contexts. This proved to be highly effective in applications such as link prediction and ranking.",P1,P1
7306,Style Matters! Investigating Linguistic Style in Online Communities,Osama Khalid|Padmini Srinivasan,"Content has historically been the primary lens used to study language in online communities. This paper instead focuses on the linguistic style of communities. While we know that individuals have distinguishable styles, here we ask whether communities have distinguishable styles. Additionally, while prior work has relied on a narrow definition of style, we employ a broad definition involving 262 features to analyze the linguistic style of 9 online communities from 3 social media platforms discussing politics, television and travel. We find that communities indeed have distinct styles. Also, style is an excellent predictor of group membership (F-score 0.952 and Accuracy 96.09%). While on average it is statistically equivalent to predictions using content alone, it is more resilient to reductions in training data.",P10,P10
7307,Social Media Relevance Filtering Using Perplexity-Based Positive-Unlabelled Learning,Sunghwan Mac Kim|Stephen Wan|Cécile Paris|Andreas Duenser,"Internet user-generated data, like Twitter, offers data scientists a public real-time data source that can provide insights, supplementing traditional data. However, identifying relevant data for such analyses can be time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce our Perplexity variant of Positive-Unlabelled Learning (PPUL) framework as a means to perform social media relevance filtering. We note that this task is particularly well suited to a PU Learning approach. We demonstrate how perplexity can identify candidate examples of the negative class, using language models. To learn such models, we experiment with both statistical methods and a Variational Autoencoder. Our PPUL method generally outperforms strong PU Learning baselines, which we demonstrate on five different data sets: the Hazardous Product Review data set, two well known social media data sets, and two real case studies in relevance filtering. All datasets have manual annotations for evaluation, and, in each case, PPUL attains state-of-the-art performance, with gains ranging from 4 to 17% improvement over competitive baselines. We show that the PPUL framework is effective when the amount of positive annotated data is small, and it is appropriate for both content that is triggered by an event and a general topic of interest.",S3,S3
7308,What Makes People Feel Close to Online Groups? The Roles of Group Attributes and Group Types,Robert E. Kraut|John M. Levine|Marisol Martinez Escobar|Amaç Herdağdelen,"Most research assumes that the determinants of members’ feelings of connection to groups are constant across types of groups. The current paper challenges this assumption by assessing members' feelings of affinity toward a large, diverse sample of online groups. 10,567 members of 6,458 Facebook groups reported on their feelings of connection to these groups. Objectively measured group characteristics and features of members' relationship to the groups explained over 16% of the variance in members’ affinity. Being an administrator and being in groups with fewer members, more even communication, and more close friends were the strongest predictors. Half of the independent variables significantly interacted with group type in predicting affinity (e.g., large group size was negatively associated with affinity in task groups and positively associated with affinity in topical groups).",P6,P6
7309,Driving the Last Mile: Characterizing and Understanding Distracted Driving Posts on Social Networks,Hemank Lamba|Shashank Srikanth|Dheeraj Reddy Pailla|Shwetanshu Singh|Karandeep Singh Juneja|Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,"In 2015, 391,000 people were injured due to distracted driving in the US. One of the major reasons behind distracted driving is the use of cell-phones, accounting for 14% of fatal crashes. Social media applications have enabled users to stay connected, however, the use of such applications while driving could have serious repercussions - often leading the user to be distracted from the road and ending up in an accident. In the context of impression management, it has been discovered that individuals often take a risk (such as teens smoking cigarettes, indulging in narcotics, and participating in unsafe sex) to improve their social standing. Therefore, viewing the phenomena of posting distracted driving posts under the lens of self-presentation, it can be hypothesized that users often indulge in risk-taking behavior on social media to improve their impression among their peers. In this paper, we first try to understand the severity of such social-media-based distractions by analyzing the content posted on a popular social media site where the user is driving and is also simultaneously creating content. To this end, we build a deep learning classifier to identify publicly posted content on social media that involves the user driving. Furthermore, a framework proposed to understand factors behind voluntary risk-taking activity observes that younger individuals are more willing to perform such activities, and men (as opposed to women) are more inclined to take risks. Grounding our observations in this framework, we test these hypotheses on 173 cities across the world. We conduct spatial and temporal analysis on a city-level and understand how distracted driving content posting behavior changes due to varied demographics. We discover that the factors put forth by the framework are significant in estimating the extent of such behavior.",P10,P10
7310,Bridging Qualitative and Quantitative Methods for User Modeling: Tracing Cancer Patient Behavior in an Online Health Community,Zachary Levonian|Drew Richard Erikson|Wenqi Luo|Saumik Narayanan|Sabirat Rubya|Prateek Vachher|Loren Terveen|Svetlana Yarosh,"Researchers construct models of social media users to understand human behavior and deliver improved digital services. Such models use conceptual categories arranged in a taxonomy to classify unstructured user text data. In many contexts, useful taxonomies can be defined via the incorporation of qualitative findings, a mixed-methods approach that offers the ability to create qualitatively-informed user models. But operationalizing taxonomies from the themes described in qualitative work is non-trivial and has received little explicit focus. We propose a process and explore challenges bridging qualitative themes to user models, for both operationalization of themes to taxonomies and the use of these taxonomies in constructing classification models. For classification of new data, we compare common keyword-based approaches to machine learning models. We demonstrate our process through an example in the health domain, constructing two user models tracing cancer patient experience over time in an online health community. We identify patterns in the model outputs for describing the longitudinal experience of cancer patients and reflect on the use of this process in future research.",P5,P5
7311,Detecting Troll Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study of Russian Trolls in the 2016 US Election,Luca Luceri|Silvia Giordano|Emilio Ferrara,"Since the 2016 US Presidential election, social media abuse has been eliciting massive concern in the academic community and beyond. Preventing and limiting the malicious activity of users, such as trolls and bots, in their manipulation campaigns is of paramount importance for the integrity of democracy, public health, and more. However, the automated detection of troll accounts is an open challenge. In this work, we propose an approach based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to capture troll behavior and identify troll accounts. We employ IRL to infer a set of online incentives that may steer user behavior, which in turn highlights behavioral differences between troll and non-troll accounts, enabling their accurate classification. As a study case, we consider the troll accounts identified by the US Congress during the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 US Presidential election. We report promising results: the IRL-based approach is able to accurately detect troll accounts (AUC=89.1%). The differences in the predictive features between the two classes of accounts enables a principled understanding of the distinctive behaviors reflecting the incentives trolls and non-trolls respond to.",P6,P6
7312,Source Attribution: Recovering the Press Releases Behind Health Science News,Ansel MacLaughlin|John Wihbey|Aleszu Bajak|David A. Smith,"We explore the task of intrinsic source attribution: inferring which portions of a derived document were adapted from an unobserved source document. Specifically, we model the relationship between news articles and their press release sources using a dataset of 64,784 health science news articles and 23,068 press releases. We approach the problem at the sentence level and work with science journalism professors to develop a four point Likert scale describing the extent to which a news article sentence is derived from the content in the corresponding press release. Because manual annotation of news article - press release pairs is time-consuming, we turn to a mix of expert, non-expert, and heuristic-based annotation to label our dataset. After a small pilot study, which found that humans, when only able to view the text of the news article, struggle to identify which content is derived or not, we compare four different sentence regression models on the task. We find that modeling a sentence's context in the entire document is important, with the best performing model, a sequence regression model with BERT token representations, achieving a spearman's ρ of 0.49 and NDCG@1 of 0.60 on the expert-labeled test set. Examining the model's predictions, we find that it successfully identifies copied or closely paraphrased sentences in articles with a mix of derived and original content, but struggles to differentiate between loosely paraphrased and original sentences in articles with mostly original writing.",P8,P8
7313,See and Read: Detecting Depression Symptoms in Higher Education Students Using Multimodal Social Media Data,Paulo Mann|Aline Paes|Elton H. Matsushima,"Mental disorders such as depression and anxiety have been increasing at alarming rates in the worldwide population. Notably, the major depressive disorder has become a common problem among higher education students, aggravated, and maybe even occasioned, by the academic pressures they must face. While the reasons for this alarming situation remain unclear (although widely investigated), the student already facing this problem must receive treatment. To that, it is first necessary to screen the symptoms. The traditional way for that is relying on clinical consultations or answering questionnaires. However, nowadays, the data shared at social media is a ubiquitous source that can be used to detect the depression symptoms even when the student is not able to afford or search for professional care. Previous works have already relied on social media data to detect depression on the general population, usually focusing on either posted images or texts or relying on metadata. In this work, we focus on detecting the severity of the depression symptoms in higher education students, by comparing deep learning to feature engineering models induced from both the pictures and their captions posted on Instagram. The experimental results show that students presenting a BDI score higher or equal than 20 can be detected with 0.92 of recall and 0.69 of precision in the best case, reached by a fusion model. Our findings show the potential of large-scale depression screening, which could shed light upon students at-risk.",P8,P8
7314,“And We Will Fight for Our Race!” A Measurement Study of Genetic Testing Conversations on Reddit and 4chan,Alexandros Mittos|Savvas Zannettou|Jeremy Blackburn|Emiliano De Cristofaro,"Progress in genomics has enabled the emergence of a booming market for “direct-to-consumer” genetic testing. Nowadays, companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA provide affordable health, genealogy, and ancestry reports, and have already tested tens of millions of customers. At the same time, alt- and far-right groups have also taken an interest in genetic testing, using them to attack minorities and prove their genetic “purity.” In this paper, we present a measurement study shedding light on how genetic testing is being discussed on Web communities in Reddit and 4chan. We collect 1.3M comments posted over 27 months on the two platforms, using a set of 280 keywords related to genetic testing. We then use NLP and computer vision tools to identify trends, themes, and topics of discussion. Our analysis shows that genetic testing attracts a lot of attention on Reddit and 4chan, with discussions often including highly toxic language expressed through hateful, racist, and misogynistic comments. In particular, on 4chan's politically incorrect board (/pol/), content from genetic testing conversations involves several alt-right personalities and openly antisemitic rhetoric, often conveyed through memes. Finally, we find that discussions build around user groups, from technology enthusiasts to communities promoting fringe political views.",P7,P7
7315,Examining Peer-to-Peer and Patient-Provider Interactions on a Social Media Community Facilitating Ask the Doctor Services,Alicia L. Nobles|Eric C. Leas|Mark Dredze|John W. Ayers,"Ask the Doctor (AtD) services provide patients the opportunity to seek medical advice using online platforms. While these services represent a new mode of healthcare delivery, study of these online health communities and how they are used is limited. In particular, it is unknown if these platforms replicate existing barriers and biases in traditional healthcare delivery across demographic groups. We present an analysis of AskDocs, a subreddit that functions as a public AtD platform on social media. We examine the demographics of users, the health topics discussed, if biases present in offline healthcare settings exist on this platform, and how empathy is expressed in interactions between users and physicians. Our findings suggest a number of implications to enhance and support peer-to-peer and patient-provider interactions on online platforms.",P3,P3
7316,Gravity of Location-Based Service: Analyzing the Effects for Mobility Pattern and Location Prediction,Keiichi Ochiai|Yusuke Fukazawa|Wataru Yamada|Hiroyuki Manabe|Yutaka Matsuo,"Predicting user location is one of the most important topics in data mining. Although human mobility is reasonably predictable for frequently visited places, novel location prediction is much more difficult. However, location-based services (LBSs) can influence users' choice of destination and can be exploited to more accurately predict user location even for new locations. In this study, we assessed the behavior difference for specific LBS users and non-users by using large-scale check-in data. We found a remarkable difference between specific LBS users and non-users (e.g., check-in locations) that had previously not been revealed. Then, we proposed a location prediction method exploiting the characteristics of check-in locations and analyzed how specific LBS usage influences location predictability. We assumed that users who use the same LBS tend to visit similar locations. The results showed that the novel location predictability of specific LBS users is up to 43.9% higher than that of non-users.",S2,S2
7317,Identity-Based Roles in Rhizomatic Social Justice Movements on Twitter,Judeth Oden Choi|James Herbsleb|Jessica Hammer|Jodi Forlizzi,"Contemporary social justice movements can be understood as rhizomatic, growing laterally without a central structure. In this mixed methods study, we investigated the roles that activists develop based on their personal and professional identities and carry with them through the dynamic landscape of rhizomatic social justice movements on Twitter. We conducted interviews with self-identified social justice activists and analyzed seven weeks of their Twitter timeline and retweets. We found three activist roles–organizer, storyteller and advocate–and described the identities, approaches to activism, behaviors on Twitter, and the relationship to social justice movements for each role. We used these roles as a lens to better understand how movement identities are constructed, laid out an agenda for future research on roles in rhizomatic social justice movements and suggested design directions.",P6,P6
7318,The Structure of U.S. College Networks on Facebook,Jan Overgoor|Bogdan State|Lada A. Adamic,"Anecdotally, social connections made in university have life-long impact. Yet knowledge of social networks formed in college remains episodic, due in large part to the difficulty and expense involved in collecting a suitable dataset for comprehensive analysis. To advance and systematize insight into college social networks, we describe a dataset of the largest online social network platform used by college students in the United States. We combine de-identified and aggregated Facebook data with College Scorecard data, campus-level information provided by U.S. Department of Education, to produce a dataset covering the 2008-2015 entry year cohorts for 1,159 U.S. colleges and universities, spanning 7.6 million students. To perform the difficult task of comparing these networks of different sizes we develop a new methodology. We compute features over sampled ego-graphs, train binary classifiers for every pair of graphs, and operationalize distance between graphs as predictive accuracy. Social networks of different year cohorts at the same school are structurally more similar to one another than to cohorts at other schools. Networks from similar schools have similar structures, with the public/private and graduation rate dimensions being the most distinguishable. We also relate school types to specific outcomes. For example, students at private schools have larger networks that are more clustered and with higher homophily by year. Our findings may help illuminate the role that colleges play in shaping social networks which partly persist throughout people's lives.",P9,P9
7319,Influence Maximization Using Influence and Susceptibility Embeddings,George Panagopoulos|Fragkiskos D. Malliaros|Michalis Vazirgianis,"Finding a set of users that can maximize the spread of information in a social network is an important problem in social media analysis — being a critical part of several real-world applications such as viral marketing, political advertising and epidemiology. Although influence maximization has been studied extensively in the past, the majority of works focus on the algorithmic aspect of the problem, overlooking several practical improvements that can be derived by data-driven observations or the inclusion of machine learning. The main challenges of realistic influence maximization is on the one hand the computational demand of the diffusion models' repetitive simulations, and on the other the accuracy of the estimated influence spread. In this work, we propose Celfie, an influence maximization method that utilizes learnt influence representations from diffusion cascades to overcome the use of diffusion models. It comprises of two parts. The first is based on Inf2vec, an unsupervised learning model that embeds influence relationships between nodes from a set of diffusion cascades. We create a new version of the model, based on observations from influence analysis on a large scale dataset, to match the scalability needs and the purpose of influence maximization. The second part capitalizes on the learned representations to redefine the traditional live-edge model sampling for the computation of the marginal gain. For evaluation, we apply our method in the Sina Weibo and Microsoft Academic Graph datasets, two large scale networks accompanied by diffusion cascades. We observe that our algorithm outperforms various baseline methods in terms of seed set quality and speed. In addition, the proposed Inf2vec modification for influence maximization provides substantial computational advantages in the price of a minuscule loss in the influence spread.",P4,P4
7320,Disturbed YouTube for Kids: Characterizing and Detecting Inappropriate Videos Targeting Young Children,Kostantinos Papadamou|Antonis Papasavva|Savvas Zannettou|Jeremy Blackburn|Nicolas Kourtellis|Ilias Leontiadis|Gianluca Stringhini|Michael Sirivianos,"A large number of the most-subscribed YouTube channels target children of very young age. Hundreds of toddler-oriented channels on YouTube feature inoffensive, well produced, and educational videos. Unfortunately, inappropriate content that targets this demographic is also common. YouTube's algorithmic recommendation system regrettably suggests inappropriate content because some of it mimics or is derived from otherwise appropriate content. Considering the risk for early childhood development, and an increasing trend in toddler's consumption of YouTube media, this is a worrisome problem. In this work, we build a classifier able to discern inappropriate content that targets toddlers on YouTube with 84.3% accuracy, and leverage it to perform a large-scale, quantitative characterization that reveals some of the risks of YouTube media consumption by young children. Our analysis reveals that YouTube is still plagued by such disturbing videos and its currently deployed counter-measures are ineffective in terms of detecting them in a timely manner. Alarmingly, using our classifier we show that young children are not only able, but likely to encounter disturbing videos when they randomly browse the platform starting from benign videos.",P8,P8
7321,"“Trust Me, I Have a Ph.D.”: A Propensity Score Analysis on the Halo Effect of Disclosing One's Offline Social Status in Online Communities",Kunwoo Park|Haewoon Kwak|Hyunho Song|Meeyoung Cha,"Online communities adopt various reputation schemes to measure content quality. This study analyzes the effect of a new reputation scheme that exposes one's offline social status, such as an education degree, within an online community. We study two Reddit communities that adopted this scheme, whereby posts include tags identifying education status referred to as flairs, and we examine how the “transferred” social status affects the interactions among the users. We computed propensity scores to test whether flairs give ad-hoc authority to the adopters while minimizing the effects of confounding variables such as topics of content. The results show that exposing academic degrees is likely to lead to higher audience votes as well as larger discussion size, compared to the users without the disclosed identities, in a community that covers peer-reviewed scientific articles. In another community with a focus on casual science topics, exposing mere academic degrees did not obtain such benefits. Still, the users with the highest degree (e.g., Ph.D. or M.D.) were likely to receive more feedback from the audience. These findings suggest that reputation schemes that link the offline and online worlds could induce halo effects on feedback behaviors differently depending upon the community culture. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of future reputation mechanisms.",P3,P3
7322,Purchase Intentions on Social Media as Predictors of Consumer Spending,Viktor Pekar,"The paper addresses the problem of forecasting consumer expenditure from social media data. Previous research of the topic exploited the intuition that search engine traffic reflects purchase intentions and constructed predictive models of consumer behaviour from search query volumes. In contrast, we derive predictors from explicit expressions of purchase intentions found in social media posts. Two types of predictors created from these expressions are explored: those based on word embeddings and those based on topical word clusters. We introduce a new clustering method, which takes into account temporal co-occurrence of words, in addition to their semantic similarity, in order to create predictors relevant to the forecasting problem. The predictors are evaluated against baselines that use only macroeconomic variables, and against models trained on search traffic data. Conducting experiments with three different regression methods on Facebook and Twitter data, we find that both word embeddings and word clusters help to reduce forecasting errors in comparison to purely macroeconomic models. In most experimental settings, the error reduction is statistically significant, and is comparable to error reduction achieved with search traffic variables.",P1,P1
7323,"Quick, Community-Specific Learning: How Distinctive Toxicity Norms Are Maintained in Political Subreddits",Ashwin Rajadesingan|Paul Resnick|Ceren Budak,"Online communities about similar topics may maintain very different norms of interaction. Past research identifies many processes that contribute to maintaining stable norms, including self-selection, pre-entry learning, post-entry learning, and retention. We analyzed political subreddits that had distinctive, stable levels of toxic comments on Reddit, in order to identify the relative contribution of these four processes. Surprisingly, we find that the largest source of norm stability is pre-entry learning. That is, newcomers' first comments in these distinctive subreddits differ from those same people's prior behavior in other subreddits. Through this adjustment, they nearly match the toxicity level of the subreddit they are joining. We also show that behavior adjustments are community-specific and not broadly transformative. That is, people continue to post toxic comments at their previous rates in other political subreddits. Thus, we conclude that in political subreddits, compatible newcomers are neither born nor made– they make local adjustments on their own.",P10,P10
7324,"Hyperpartisanship, Disinformation and Political Conversations on Twitter: The Brazilian Presidential Election of 2018",Raquel Recuero|Felipe Bonow Soares|Anatoliy Gruzd,"This paper examines the role of hyperpartisanship and polarization on Twitter during the 2018 Brazilian Presidential Election. Based on a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed a dataset of over 8 million tweets about Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right candidate from the Social Liberty Party. Our results show that there is a strong connection between polarization, hyperpartisanship and disinformation. As the centrality of hyperpartisan outlets on Twitter grew, more traditional media outlets became less central and conversations became more polarized. We also confirmed that hyperpartisan outlets often shared disinformation or biased information, presented as a “truth-telling” alternative to journalistic outlets. And while disinformation was more frequently observed in the far-right group, it was also present in the anti-Bolsonaro cluster, especially towards the runoff period.",P3,P3
7325,Top Comment or Flop Comment? Predicting and Explaining User Engagement in Online News Discussions,Julian Risch|Ralf Krestel,"Comment sections below online news articles enjoy growing popularity among readers.

Most platforms display comments in chronological order, which neglects that some of them are more relevant to users and are better conversation starters.",S1,S1
7326,Causal Factors of Effective Psychosocial Outcomes in Online Mental Health Communities,Koustuv Saha|Amit Sharma,"Online mental health communities enable people to seek and provide support, and growing evidence shows the efficacy of community participation to cope with mental health distress. However, what factors of peer support lead to favorable psychosocial outcomes for individuals is less clear. Using a dataset of over 300K posts by ∼39K individuals on an online community TalkLife, we present a study to investigate the effect of several factors, such as adaptability, diversity, immediacy, and the nature of support. Unlike typical causal studies that focus on the effect of each treatment, we focus on the outcome and address the reverse causal question of identifying treatments that may have led to the outcome, drawing on case-control studies in epidemiology. Specifically, we define the outcome as an aggregate of affective, behavioral, and cognitive psychosocial change and identify Case (most improved) and Control (least improved) cohorts of individuals. Considering responses from peers as treatments, we evaluate the differences in the responses received by Case and Control, per matched clusters of similar individuals. We find that effective support includes complex language factors such as diversity, adaptability, and style, but simple indicators such as quantity and immediacy are not causally relevant. Our work bears methodological and design implications for online mental health platforms, and has the potential to guide suggestive interventions for peer supporters on these platforms.",P5,P5
7327,Characterizing the Social Media News Sphere through User Co-Sharing Practices,Mattia Samory|Vartan Kesiz Abnousi|Tanushree Mitra,"We describe the landscape of news sources which share social media audience. We focus on 639 news sources, both credible and questionable, and characterize them according to the audience that shares their articles on Twitter. Based on user co-sharing practices, what communities of news sources emerge? We find four groups: one is home to mainstream, high-circulation sources from all sides of the political spectrum; one to satirical, left-leaning sources; one to bipartisan conspiratorial, pseudo-scientific sources; and one to right-leaning, deliberate misinformation sources. Next, we measure which assessments of credibility, impartiality, and journalistic integrity correspond to social media readers' choices of news sources, and uncover the multifaceted structure of the social news sphere. We show how news articles shared on Twitter differ across the four groups along linguistic and psycholinguistics measures. Further, we find that with a high degree of accuracy (∼80%), we can classify in what news community an article belongs to. Our data-driven categorization of news sources will help to navigate the complex landscape of online news and has implications for social media platform maintainers to reliably triage questionable outlets.",P1,P1
7328,Engagement Patterns of Peer-to-Peer Interactions on Mental Health Platforms,Ashish Sharma|Monojit Choudhury|Tim Althoff|Amit Sharma,"Mental illness is a global health problem, but access to mental healthcare resources remain poor worldwide. Online peer-to-peer support platforms attempt to alleviate this fundamental gap by enabling those who struggle with mental illness to provide and receive social support from their peers. However, successful social support requires users to engage with each other and failures may have serious consequences for users in need. Our understanding of engagement patterns on mental health platforms is limited but critical to inform the role, limitations, and design of these platforms. Here, we present a large-scale analysis of engagement patterns of 35 million posts on two popular online mental health platforms, TalkLife and Reddit. Leveraging communication models in human-computer interaction and communication theory, we operationalize a set of four engagement indicators based on attention and interaction. We then propose a generative model to jointly model these indicators of engagement, the output of which is synthesized into a novel set of eleven distinct, interpretable patterns. We demonstrate that this framework of engagement patterns enables informative evaluations and analysis of online support platforms. Specifically, we find that mutual back-and-forth interactions are associated with significantly higher user retention rates on TalkLife. Such back-and-forth interactions, in turn, are associated with early response times and the sentiment of posts.",P4,P4
7329,Hierarchical Propagation Networks for Fake News Detection: Investigation and Exploitation,Kai Shu|Deepak Mahudeswaran|Suhang Wang|Huan Liu,"Consuming news from social media is becoming increasingly popular. However, social media also enables the wide dissemination of fake news. Because of the detrimental effects of fake news, fake news detection has attracted increasing attention. However, the performance of detecting fake news only from news content is generally limited as fake news pieces are written to mimic true news. In the real world, news pieces spread through propagation networks on social media. The news propagation networks usually involve multi-levels. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of investigating and exploiting news hierarchical propagation network on social media for fake news detection.",P4,P4
7330,Measuring Edge Sparsity on Large Social Networks,J. David Smith|My T. Thai,"How strong are the connections between individuals? This is a fundamental question in the study of social networks. In this work, we take a topological view rooted in the idea of local sparsity to answer this question on large social networks to which we have only incomplete access. Prior approaches to measuring network structure are not applicable to this setting due to the strict limits on data availability. Therefore, we propose a new metric, the Edgecut Weight, for this task. This metric can be calculated efficiently in an online fashion, and we empirically show that it captures important elements of communities. Further, we demonstrate that the distribution of these weights characterizes connectivity on a network. Subsequently, we estimate the distribution of weights on Twitter and show both a lack of strong connections and a corresponding lack of community structure.",P10,P10
7331,Characterizing Collective Attention via Descriptor Context: A Case Study of Public Discussions of Crisis Events,Ian Stewart|Diyi Yang|Jacob Eisenstein,"Social media datasets make it possible to rapidly quantify collective attention to emerging topics and breaking news, such as crisis events. Collective attention is typically measured by aggregate counts, such as the number of posts that mention a name or hashtag. But according to rationalist models of natural language communication, the collective salience of each entity will be expressed not only in how often it is mentioned, but in the form that those mentions take. This is because natural language communication is premised on (and customized to) the expectations that speakers and writers have about how their messages will be interpreted by the intended audience. We test this idea by conducting a large-scale analysis of public online discussions of breaking news events on Facebook and Twitter, focusing on five recent crisis events. We examine how people refer to locations, focusing specifically on contextual descriptors, such as “San Juan” versus “San Juan, Puerto Rico.” Rationalist accounts of natural language communication predict that such descriptors will be unnecessary (and therefore omitted) when the named entity is expected to have high prior salience to the reader. We find that the use of contextual descriptors is indeed associated with proxies for social and informational expectations, including macro-level factors like the location's global salience and micro-level factors like audience engagement. We also find a consistent decrease in descriptor context use over the lifespan of each crisis event. These findings provide evidence about how social media users communicate with their audiences, and point towards more fine-grained models of collective attention that may help researchers and crisis response organizations to better understand public perception of unfolding crisis events.",P3,P3
7332,An Experimental Study of Structural Diversity in Social Networks,Jessica Su|Krishna Kamath|Aneesh Sharma|Johan Ugander|Sharad Goel,"Several recent studies of online social networking platforms have found that adoption rates and engagement levels are positively correlated with structural diversity, the degree of heterogeneity among an individual's contacts as measured by network ties. One common theory for this observation is that structural diversity increases utility, in part because there is value to interacting with people from different network components on the same platform. While compelling, evidence for this causal theory comes from observational studies, making it difficult to rule out non-causal explanations. We investigate the role of structural diversity on retention by conducting a large-scale randomized controlled study on the Twitter platform. We first show that structural diversity correlates with user retention on Twitter, corroborating results from past observational studies. We then exogenously vary structural diversity by altering the set of network recommendations new users see when joining the platform; we confirm that this design induces the desired changes to network topology. We find, however, that low, medium, and high structural diversity treatment groups in our experiment have comparable retention rates. Thus, at least in this case, the observed correlation between structural diversity and retention does not appear to result from a causal relationship, challenging theories based on past observational studies.",P3,P3
7333,Quasi-Experimental Designs for Assessing Response on Social Media to Policy Changes,Yijun Tian|Rumi Chunara,"Regulation of tobacco products is rapidly evolving. Understanding public sentiment in response to changes is very important as authorities assess how to effectively protect population health. Social media systems are widely recognized to be useful for collecting data about human preferences and perceptions. However, how social media data may be used, in rapid policy change settings, given challenges of narrow time periods and specific locations and non-representative the population using social media is an open question. In this paper we apply quasi-experimental designs, which have been used previously in observational data such as social media, to control for time and location confounders on social media, and then use content analysis of Twitter and Reddit posts to illustrate the content of reactions to tobacco flavor bans and the effect of taxation on e-cigarettes. Conclusions distill the potential role of social media in settings of rapidly changing regulation, in complement to what is learned by traditional denominator-based representative surveys.",S2,S2
7334,Empirical Analysis of Multi-Task Learning for Reducing Identity Bias in Toxic Comment Detection,Ameya Vaidya|Feng Mai|Yue Ning,"With the recent rise of toxicity in online conversations on social media platforms, using modern machine learning algorithms for toxic comment detection has become a central focus of many online applications. Researchers and companies have developed a variety of models to identify toxicity in online conversations, reviews, or comments with mixed successes. However, many existing approaches have learned to incorrectly associate non-toxic comments that have certain trigger-words (e.g. gay, lesbian, black, muslim) as a potential source of toxicity. In this paper, we evaluate several state-of-the-art models with the specific focus of reducing model bias towards these commonly-attacked identity groups. We propose a multi-task learning model with an attention layer that jointly learns to predict the toxicity of a comment as well as the identities present in the comments in order to reduce this bias. We then compare our model to an array of shallow and deep-learning models using metrics designed especially to test for unintended model bias within these identity groups.",P10,P10
7335,Pie Chart or Pizza: Identifying Chart Types and Their Virality on Twitter,Pavlos Vougiouklis|Leslie Carr|Elena Simperl,"We aim to understand how data, rendered visually as charts or infographics, “travels” on social media. To do so we propose a neural network architecture that is trained to distinguish among different types of charts, for instance line graphs or scatter plots, and predict how much they will be shared. This poses significant challenges because of the varying format and quality of the charts that are posted, and the limitations in existing training data. To start with, our proposed system outperforms related work in chart type classification on the ReVision corpus. Furthermore, we use crowdsourcing to build a new corpus, more suitable to our aims, consisting of chart images shared by data journalists on Twitter. We evaluate our system on the second corpus with respect to both chart identification and virality prediction, with promising results.",P3,P3
7336,Local Trends in Global Music Streaming,Samuel F. Way|Jean Garcia-Gathright|Henriette Cramer,"Audio streaming services have made it easier for countries around the world to listen to each other's music. This expansion in listeners' access to global content, however, has raised questions about streaming's impact on the import and export flows of music between countries and their preferences for local or global content. Here, we analyze five and a half years of all streaming data from Spotify, a global music streaming service, and find that preferences for local content have increased from 2014 through 2019, reversing previously noted trends. Perhaps correspondingly, both common official language and geographic proximity between countries increasingly shape listener consumption during this period, particularly for younger audiences. Further, we show that these trends persist across different genres, listener age groups, and early- and late-adopters of streaming, providing new insights into this newest phase in the continued evolution of music and its impact on listeners around the world.",P2,P2
7337,Variation across Scales: Measurement Fidelity under Twitter Data Sampling,Siqi Wu|Marian-Andrei Rizoiu|Lexing Xie,"A comprehensive understanding of data quality is the cornerstone of measurement studies in social media research. This paper presents in-depth measurements on the effects of Twitter data sampling across different timescales and different subjects (entities, networks, and cascades). By constructing complete tweet streams, we show that Twitter rate limit message is an accurate indicator for the volume of missing tweets. Sampling also differs significantly across timescales. While the hourly sampling rate is influenced by the diurnal rhythm in different time zones, the millisecond level sampling is heavily affected by the implementation choices. For Twitter entities such as users, we find the Bernoulli process with a uniform rate approximates the empirical distributions well. It also allows us to estimate the true ranking with the observed sample data. For networks on Twitter, their structures are altered significantly and some components are more likely to be preserved. For retweet cascades, we observe changes in distributions of tweet inter-arrival time and user influence, which will affect models that rely on these features. This work calls attention to noises and potential biases in social data, and provides a few tools to measure Twitter sampling effects.",P7,P7
7338,Understanding the Political Ideology of Legislators from Social Media Images,Nan Xi|Di Ma|Marcus Liou|Zachary C. Steinert-Threlkeld|Jason Anastasopoulos|Jungseock Joo,"In this paper, we seek to understand how politicians use images to express ideological rhetoric through Facebook images posted by members of the U.S. House and Senate. In the era of social media, politics has become saturated with imagery, a potent and emotionally salient form of political rhetoric which has been used by politicians and political organizations to influence public sentiment and voting behavior for well over a century. To date, however, little is known about how images are used as political rhetoric. Using deep learning techniques to automatically predict Republican or Democratic party affiliation solely from the Facebook photographs of the members of the 114th U.S. Congress, we demonstrate that predicted class probabilities from our model function as an accurate proxy of the political ideology of images along a left–right (liberal–conservative) dimension. After controlling for the gender and race of politicians, our method achieves an accuracy of 59.28% from single photographs and 82.35% when aggregating scores from multiple photographs (up to 150) of the same person. To better understand image content distinguishing liberal from conservative images, we also perform in-depth content analyses of the photographs. Our findings suggest that conservatives tend to use more images supporting status quo political institutions and hierarchy maintenance, featuring individuals from dominant social groups, and displaying greater happiness than liberals.",P7,P7
7339,MimicProp: Learning to Incorporate Lexicon Knowledge into Distributed Word Representation for Social Media Analysis,Muheng Yan|Yu-Ru Lin|Rebecca Hwa|Ali Mert Ertugrul|Meiqi Guo|Wen-Ting Chung,"Lexicon-based methods and word embeddings are the two widely used approaches for analyzing texts in social media. The choice of an approach can have a significant impact on the reliability of the text analysis. For example, lexicons provide manually curated, domain-specific attributes about a limited set of words, while word embeddings learn to encode some loose semantic interpretations for a much broader set of words. Text analysis can benefit from a representation that offers both the broad coverage of word embeddings and the domain knowledge of lexicons. This paper presents MimicProp, a new graph-mode method that learns a lexicon-aligned word embedding. Our approach improves over prior graph-based methods in terms of its interpretability (i.e., lexicon attributes can be recovered) and generalizability (i.e., new words can be learned to incorporate lexicon knowledge). It also effectively improves the performance of downstream analysis applications, such as text classification.",S1,S1
7340,"“Musicalization of the Culture”: Is Music Becoming Louder, More Repetitive, Monotonous and Simpler?",Yukun Yang,"“Musicalization of the culture” is the social science concept proposed by American philosopher George Stainer. He depicted the glooming future of music—it would become omnipresent while having increasing volume, repetitiveness, and monotony, which are ascribed to the debase of literal aesthetics. Although research that relates to one or some of these predictions exists, neither of them encompass all these “musicalization” manifestations, nor do they study the trend of these predictions over time. Therefore, this preliminary research tries to validate whether music has gained acoustic loudness, and lyrical repetitiveness, monotony, and simplicity in a computational fashion. Conducting time-series analysis with trend detection, we confirmed the increasing trends of acoustic loudness and repetitiveness but not monotony and simplicity from 1970 to 2016 using the MetroLyrics dataset and Spotify API. To investigate the simultaneity of these trends, we further conducted synchrony analysis and found little evidence indicating they would influence each other in a lagged fashion. In light of the results, we briefly discussed our findings by relating to the music industry change in reality. Our research made the first attempt to answer this music sociological preposition. On top of this, we also proposed novel metrics to quantify repetitiveness using closed frequent sequential pattern mining, which could be illuminating for future research.",P1,P1
7341,Diffusion of Scientific Articles across Online Platforms,Igor Zakhlebin|Emoke-Ágnes Horvát,"Online platforms have become the primary source of information about scientific advances for the wider public. As online dissemination of scientific findings increasingly influences personal decision-making and government action, there is a growing necessity and interest in studying how people disseminate research findings online beyond one individual platform. In this paper, we study the simultaneous diffusion of scientific articles across major online platforms based on 63 million mentions of about 7.2 million articles spanning a 7-year period. First, we find commonalities between people sharing science and other content such as news articles and memes. Specifically, we find recurring bursts in the coverage of individual articles with initial bursts co-occurring in time across platforms. This allows for a ranking of individual platforms based on the speed at which they pick up scientific information. Second, we explore specifics of sharing science. We reconstruct the likely underlying structure of information diffusion and investigate the transfer of information about scientific articles within and across different platforms. In particular, we (i) study the role of different users in the dissemination of information to better understand who are the prime sharers of knowledge, (ii) explore the propagation of articles between platforms, and (iii) analyze the structural virality of individual information cascades to place science sharing on the spectrum between pure broadcasting and peer-to-peer diffusion. Our work provides the broadest study to date about the sharing of science online and builds the basis for an informed model of the dynamics of research coverage across platforms.",P6,P6

7344,Sentiment Paradoxes in Social Networks: Why Your Friends Are More Positive Than You?,Xinyi Zhou|Shengmin Jin|Reza Zafarani,"Most people consider their friends to be more positive than themselves, exhibiting a  Sentiment Paradox. Psychology research attributes this paradox to human cognition bias. With the goal to understand this phenomenon, we study sentiment paradoxes in social networks. Our work shows that social connections (friends, followees, or followers) of users are indeed (not just illusively) more positive than the users themselves. This is mostly due to positive users having more friends. We identify five sentiment paradoxes at different network levels ranging from triads to large-scale communities. Empirical and theoretical evidence are provided to validate the existence of such sentiment paradoxes. By investigating the relationships between the sentiment paradox and other well-developed network paradoxes, i.e., friendship paradox and activity paradox, we find that user sentiments are positively correlated to their number of friends but rarely to their social activity. Finally, we demonstrate how sentiment paradoxes can be used to predict user sentiments.",P7,P7
7345,"Aggressive, Repetitive, Intentional, Visible, and Imbalanced: Refining Representations for Cyberbullying Classification",Caleb Ziems|Ymir Vigfusson|Fred Morstatter,"Cyberbullying is a pervasive problem in online communities. To identify cyberbullying cases in large-scale social networks, content moderators depend on machine learning classifiers for automatic cyberbullying detection. However, existing models remain unfit for real-world applications, largely due to a shortage of publicly available training data and a lack of standard criteria for assigning ground truth labels. In this study, we address the need for reliable data using an original annotation framework. Inspired by social sciences research into bullying behavior, we characterize the nuanced problem of cyberbullying using five explicit factors to represent its social and linguistic aspects. We model this behavior using social network and language-based features, which improve classifier performance. These results demonstrate the importance of representing and modeling cyberbullying as a social phenomenon.",P10,P10

In this study, we present a dataset comprising 45 months (from January 2016 until September 2019) of long-running discussions on Twitter about the Brexit referendum, which can be used by social scientists and journalists for understanding the evolution of the public debate about the phenomenon. This dataset comprises 50.8 million tweets and 3.97 million users, and is also enriched with additional meta-data attributes: bot score of users, sentiment information detected by our sentiment analyzer, political stance information predicted by our stance classifier. Considering all Brexit related tweets of users during our time period, we also determine their overall stance and sentiment.",P4,P4

Massive fake health news which is spreading over the Internet, has become a severe threat to public health. Numerous studies and research works have been done in fake news detection domain, however, few of them are designed to cope with the challenges in health news. For instance, the development of explainable is required for fake health news detection. To mitigate these problems, we construct a comprehensive repository, FakeHealth, which includes news contents with rich features, news reviews with detailed explanations, social engagements and a user-user social network. Moreover, exploratory analyses are conducted to understand the characteristics of the datasets, analyze useful patterns and validate the quality of the datasets for health fake news detection.

7351,Generally Curious: Thematically Distinct Datasets of General Threads on 4chan/pol/,Emilija Jokubauskaitė|Stijn Peeters,"Over the second half of the 2010s, the /pol/ (‘politically incorrect’) forum on the 4chan image board has emerged as a space within which various extreme political ideologies are discussed and cultivated, occasionally informing off-site acts of political extremism. While previous research has often studied this space as a unified whole, it is relevant to more specifically demarcate different publics within 4chan’s /pol/ board, apart from studying it as an ‘amorphous blob’. This paper focuses specifically on ‘generals’ - recurring threads with a specific thematic focus identified by a particular vernacular phrase or tag. By identifying them it is possible to partition the board’s archive into multiple distinct datasets comprising discussions about a particular topic, such as Donald Trump, the Syria war, or British politics. We provide a dataset containing 58,841 opening posts and 13,697,738 replies to those, divided over 329 thematically distinct general thread collections. In this paper we outline our data collection and query protocol, the structure of the data and its rationale, as well as a number of suggested research uses for this new data.",P3,P3
7352,The Media Coverage of the 2020 US Presidential Election Candidates through the Lens of Google's Top Stories,Anna Kawakami|Khonzodakhon Umarova|Eni Mustafaraj,"Choosing the political party nominees, who will appear on the ballot for the US presidency, is a long process that starts two years before the general election. The news media plays a particular role in this process by continuously covering the state of the race. How can this news coverage be characterized? Given that there are thousands of news organizations, but each of us is exposed to only a few of them, we might be missing most of it. Online news aggregators, which aggregate news stories from a multitude of news sources and perspectives, could provide an important lens for the analysis. One such aggregator is Google's Top stories, a recent addition to Google's search result page. For the duration of 2019, we have collected the news headlines that Google Top stories has displayed for 30 candidates of both US political parties. Our dataset contains 79,903 news story URLs published by 2,168 unique news sources. Our analysis indicates that despite this large number of news sources, there is a very skewed distribution of where the Top stories are originating, with a very small number of sources contributing the majority of stories. We are sharing our dataset1 so that other researchers can answer questions related to algorithmic curation of news as well as media agenda setting in the context of political elections.",P3,P3
7353,WikiHist.html: English Wikipedia's Full Revision History in HTML Format,Blagoj Mitrevski|Tiziano Piccardi|Robert West,"Wikipedia is written in the wikitext markup language. When serving content, the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia parses wikitext to HTML, thereby inserting additional content by expanding macros (templates and modules). Hence, researchers who intend to analyze Wikipedia as seen by its readers should work with HTML, rather than wikitext. Since Wikipedia's revision history is publicly available exclusively in wikitext format, researchers have had to produce HTML themselves, typically by using Wikipedia's REST API for ad-hoc wikitext-to-HTML parsing. This approach, however, (1) does not scale to very large amounts of data and (2) does not correctly expand macros in historical article revisions. We solve these problems by developing a parallelized architecture for parsing massive amounts of wikitext using local instances of MediaWiki, enhanced with the capacity of correct historical macro expansion. By deploying our system, we produce and release WikiHist.html, English Wikipedia's full revision history in HTML format. We highlight the advantages of WikiHist.html over raw wikitext in an empirical analysis of Wikipedia's hyperlinks, showing that over half of the wiki links present in HTML are missing from raw wikitext, and that the missing links are important for user navigation. Data and code are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3605388.",P4,P4

To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest publicly available 4chan dataset, providing the community with an archive of posts that have been permanently deleted from 4chan and are otherwise inaccessible. We augment the data with a set of additional labels, including toxicity scores and the named entities mentioned in each post. We also present a statistical analysis of the dataset, providing an overview of what researchers interested in using it can expect, as well as a simple content analysis, shedding light on the most prominent discussion topics, the most popular entities mentioned, and the toxicity level of each post. Overall, we are confident that our work will motivate and assist researchers in studying and understanding 4chan, as well as its role on the greater Web. For instance, we hope this dataset may be used for cross-platform studies of social media, as well as being useful for other types of research like natural language processing.

Most researchers spend their time crawling Twitter, buying expensive pre-mined datasets, or tediously and slowly building datasets using the limited Twitter API. However, there are a large number of datasets that are publicly available to researchers that are underutilized or unused. In this work, we demonstrate how we mined over 9.4 billion Tweets from archive.org’s Twitter stream grab using a drug-term dictionary and plenty of computing power. Knowing that not everything that shines is gold, we used pre-existing drug-related datasets to build machine learning models to filter our findings for relevance. In this work, we present our methodology and the 3,346,758 identified tweets for public use in future research.",P5,P5
7358,Towards Using Word Embedding Vector Space for Better Cohort Analysis,Mohamed Bahgat|Steve Wilson|Walid Magdy,"On websites like Reddit, users join communities where they discuss specific topics which cluster them into possible cohorts. The authors within these cohorts have the opportunity to post more openly under the blanket of anonymity, and such openness provides a more accurate signal on the real issues individuals are facing. Some communities contain discussions about mental health struggles such as depression and suicidal ideation. To better understand and analyse these individuals, we propose to exploit properties of word embeddings that group related concepts close to each other in the embeddings space. For the posts from each topically situated sub-community, we build a word embeddings model and use handcrafted lexicons to identify emotions, values and psycholinguistically relevant concepts. We then extract insights into ways users perceive these concepts by measuring distances between them and references made by users either to themselves, others or other things around them. We show how our proposed approach can extract meaningful signals that go beyond the kinds of analyses performed at the individual word level.",P4,P4

This helps spread awareness regarding the various causes, cures and prevention methods of cancer. However, no proper analysis has been performed, which discusses the validity of such claims. In this work, we aim to tackle the misinformation spread in such platforms. We collect and present a dataset regarding tweets which talk specifically about cancer and propose an attention-based deep learning model for automated detection of misinformation along with its spread. We then do a comparative analysis of the linguistic variation in the text corresponding to misinformation and truth. This analysis helps us gather relevant insights on various social aspects related to misinformed tweets.",P1,P1

In this paper, we present a study of group split in Meetup, where a major fraction of members leave the existing group together and join a newly formed group. We identify pivotal group members, called splitters, playing key roles in group split by influencing the existing members to leave the group. We provide an in-depth analysis of the empirical data to reveal key motivating factors leading to a group split and its subsequent impact. Finally, we develop a prediction model for early detection of splitters, as well as the group members likely to be influenced by the splitter to leave the group.",P8,P8
7361,The Relative Value of Facebook Advertising Data for Poverty Mapping,Masoomali Fatehkia|Benjamin Coles|Ferda Ofli|Ingmar Weber,"Having reliable and up-to-date poverty data is a prerequisite for monitoring the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for planning effective poverty reduction interventions. Unfortunately, traditional data sources are often outdated or lacking appropriate disaggregation. As a remedy, satellite imagery has recently become prominent in obtaining geographically-fine-grained and up-to-date poverty estimates. Satellite data can pick up signals of economic activity by detecting light at night, it can pick up development status by detecting infrastructure such as roads, and it can pick up signals for individual household wealth by detecting different building footprints and roof types. It can, however, not look inside the households and pick up signals from individuals. On the other hand, alternative data sources such as audience estimates from Facebook's advertising platform provide insights into the devices and internet connection types used by individuals in different locations. Previous work has shown the value of such anonymous, publicly-accessible advertising data from Facebook for studying migration, gender gaps, crime rates, and health, among others. In this work, we evaluate the added value of using Facebook data over satellite data for mapping socioeconomic development in two low and middle income countries – the Philippines and India. We show that Facebook features perform roughly similar to satellite data in the Philippines with value added for urban locations. In India, however, where Facebook penetration is lower, satellite data perform better.",P9,P9
7362,Empirical Evaluation of Three Common Assumptions in Building Political Media Bias Datasets,Soumen Ganguly|Juhi Kulshrestha|Jisun An|Haewoon Kwak,"In this work, we empirically validate three common assumptions in building political media bias datasets, which are (i) labelers' political leanings do not affect labeling tasks, (ii) news articles follow their source outlet's political leaning, and (iii) political leaning of a news outlet is stable across different topics. We build a ground-truth dataset of manually annotated article-level political leaning and validate the three assumptions. Our findings warn that the three assumptions could be invalid even for a small dataset. We hope that our work calls attention to the (in)validity of common assumptions in building political media bias datasets.",P5,P5
7363,A Framework for Political Portmanteau Decomposition,Nabil Hossain|Minh Tran|Henry Kautz,"Portmanteaus are new words formed by combining the sounds and meanings of two words. Given their sticky nature, portmanteaus are often used to create political and personal attacks by combining a target entity with derogatory terms, which can then be spread online for promoting hate speech and defamation. In this paper, we present a framework to decompose political portmanteaus used online into their component words. Using our annotated dataset of political portmanteaus, we train a system that correctly decomposes 76.2% of the political portmanteaus into their component words. Furthermore, for 93.4% of the political portmanteaus, our system finds the correct component words in its top ten results, suggesting that using better ranking methods can lead to stronger results. This work provides a framework for both understanding an intriguing linguistic phenomena and for building hate-speech filters that could catch novel words that would bypass traditional hate speech detection approaches.",P6,P6

This misinformation is frequently spread through social media. Recently, social media companies have intervened in the dissemination of misinformation regarding vaccinations. In the current study we focus on YouTube. Recognizing the extent of the problem, YouTube implemented an informational modification that affected many videos related to vaccination beginning in February 2019. We collect original data and analyze the effects of this intervention on video viewership. We find that this informational intervention reduced traffic to the affected videos, both overall, and in comparison to a carefully-matched set of control videos that did not receive the informational modification.",P9,P9

7366,Characterizing Variation in Toxic Language by Social Context,Bahar Radfar|Karthik Shivaram|Aron Culotta,"How two people speak to one another depends heavily on the nature of their relationship. For example, the same phrase said to a friend in jest may be offensive to a stranger. In this paper, we apply this simple observation to study toxic comments in online social networks. We curate a collection of 6.7K tweets containing potentially toxic terms from users with different relationship types, as determined by the nature of their follower-friend connection. We find that such tweets between users with no connection are nearly three times as likely to be toxic as those between users who are mutual friends, and that taking into account this relationship type improves toxicity detection methods by about 5% on average. Furthermore, we provide a descriptive analysis of how toxic language varies by relationship type, finding for example that mildly offensive terms are used to express hostility more commonly between users with no social connection than users who are mutual friends.",P7,P7

The extensive experiment on real-world datasets verifies the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic crime patrol route using different evaluation metrics.",P1,P1
7368,Can Badges Foster a More Welcoming Culture on Q&A Boards?,Tiago Santos|Keith Burghardt|Kristina Lerman|Denis Helic,"Thriving online communities rely on a steady stream of newcomers to contribute new content. However, retaining newcomers has proven challenging. In this paper, we measure the success of an intervention used by Stack Exchange question-answering communities to create a more welcoming environment for newcomers. That intervention consisted in highlighting contributions by new users with a special indicator. We hypothesize that Stack Exchange's new policy would reduce negative reactions to new users and, ultimately, increase new user retention. We leverage causal modeling to assess the introduction of the so-called “new contributor indicator”, and we find it did not counter user retention decline in the short- and long-terms. However, our results indicate it did reduce unwelcoming reactions towards newcomers in the short-term. Our work has practical implications for online community managers aiming to improve their onboarding processes.",P8,P8
7369,Aligning Public Feedback to Requests for Comments on Regulations.gov,Manya Wadhwa|Silvio Amir|Mark Dredze,"In an effort to democratize the regulatory process, the United States Federal government created regulations.gov, a portal through which federal agencies can share proposed regulations and solicit feedback from the public. A proposed regulation will contain several requests for feedback on specific topics, and the public can then submit comments in response. While this reduces barriers to soliciting feedback, it still leaves regulators with a challenge: how to produce a summary and incorporate feedback from the sometimes tens of thousands of submitted comments. We propose an information retrieval system by which comments are aligned to specific regulatory requests. We evaluate several measures of semantic similarity for matching comments to information requests. We evaluate our proposed system over a dataset containing several regulations proposed for electronic cigarettes, an issue that energized tens of thousands of comments in response1.",S3,S3

7372,GeoSiteSearch: A Tool to Map Vietnamese Diaspora by Deducing Geographical Information of Web Pages about Our Lady of LaVang,Madison G. Masten|Thien-Huong Ninh|Nicholas Tran,"We construct a web tool to extract geographical locations from web pages returned by the Google search engine for an arbitrary query and display those locations on an interactive map. The tool was used to track the worldwide Vietnamese diaspora using Our Lady of LaVang as proxy for presence of a Vietnamese community, but it could potentially have other applications.",P1,P1
