A1046,Market Forces: Quantifying the Role of Top Credible Ad Servers in the Fake News Ecosystem,Lia Bozarth|Ceren Budak,"Larry Lessig argues that four modes regulate behavior in cyberspace: laws, markets, norms, and architecture. How can these four modes regulate the production and spread of fake news? In this paper, we focus on markets and empirically evaluate one particular market-based solution: top ad firms blacklisting fake news producers to eliminate their revenue sources. Our study reveals that fake and low-quality publishers demonstrate a higher tendency to serve more ads and to partner with risky ad servers than traditional news media with similar popularity and age. However, fake news publishers are still strongly reliant on credible ad servers. In fact, the top-10 credible ad servers alone account for 66.7% and 55.6% of fake and low-quality ad traffic respectively. Furthermore, our back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that, at the time of our data collection, the top-10 ad firms were receiving $985.7K to $1.15M monthly from web traffic on fake news sites, a negligible fraction of these firms' annual revenue. Overall, our findings suggest that having top ad firms blacklist known fake and low-quality publishers is a low-cost way to combat fake news.",Credibility of online content,Full Paper,P13,Misinformation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956705,static/pdfs/A1046_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18043,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1062,Uncovering Coordinated Networks on Social Media: Methods and Case Studies,Diogo Pacheco|Pik-Mai Hui|Christopher Torres-Lugo|Bao Tran Truong|Alessandro Flammini|Filippo Menczer,"Coordinated campaigns are used to influence and manipulate social media platforms and their users, a critical challenge to the free exchange of information online. Here we introduce a general, unsupervised network-based methodology to uncover groups of accounts that are likely coordinated. The proposed method constructs coordination networks based on arbitrary behavioral traces shared among accounts. We present five case studies of influence campaigns, four of which in the diverse contexts of U.S. elections, Hong Kong protests, the Syrian civil war, and cryptocurrency manipulation. In each of these cases, we detect networks of coordinated Twitter accounts by examining their identities, images, hashtag sequences, retweets, or temporal patterns.

A1071,Context-Based Quotation Recommendation,Ansel Maclaughlin|Tao Chen|Burcu Karagol Ayan|Dan Roth,"While composing a new document, anything from a news article to an email or essay, authors often utilize direct quotes from a variety of sources. Although an author may know what point they would like to make, selecting an appropriate quote for the specific context may be time-consuming and difficult. We therefore propose a novel context-aware quote recommendation system which utilizes the content an author has already written to generate a ranked list of quotable paragraphs and spans of tokens from a given source document. 

 
We approach quote recommendation as a variant of open-domain question answering and adapt the state-of-the-art BERT-based methods from open-QA to our task. We conduct experiments on a collection of speech transcripts and associated news articles, evaluating models' paragraph ranking and span prediction performances. Our experiments confirm the strong performance of BERT-based methods on this task, which outperform bag-of-words and neural ranking baselines by more than 30% relative across all ranking metrics. Qualitative analyses show the difficulty of the paragraph and span recommendation tasks and confirm the quotability of the best BERT model's predictions, even if they are not the true selected quotes from the original news articles.",Trust|reputation|recommendation systems,Full Paper,P10,Trust and Credibility,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956707,static/pdfs/A1071_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18070,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1093,Posting Bot Detection on Blockchain-based Social Media Platform using Machine Learning Techniques,Taehyun Kim|Hyomin Shin|Hyung Ju Hwang|Seungwon Jeong,"Steemit is a blockchain-based social media platform, where authors can get author rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies called STEEM and SBD (Steem Blockchain Dollars) if their posts are upvoted. Interestingly, curators (or voters) can also get rewards by voting others' posts, which is called a curation reward. A reward is proportional to a curator's STEEM stakes. Throughout this process, Steemit hopes \""good\"" content will be automatically discovered by users in a decentralized way, which is known as the Proof-of-Brain (PoB). However, there are many bot accounts programmed to post automatically and get rewards, which discourages real human users from creating good content. We call this type of bot a posting bot. While there are many papers that studied bots on traditional centralized social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, we are the first to study posting bots on a blockchain-based social media platform. Compared with the bot detection on the usual social media platforms, the features we created have an advantage that posting bots can be detected without limiting the number or length of posts. We can extract the features of posts by clustering distances between blog data or replies. These features are obtained from the Minimum Average Cluster from Clustering Distance between Frequent words and Articles (MAC-CDFA), which is not used in any of the previous social media research. Based on the enriched features, we enhanced the quality of classification tasks. Comparing the F1-scores, the features we created outperformed the features used for bot detection on Facebook and Twitter.",Credibility of online content|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Trust|reputation|recommendation systems,Full Paper,P10,Trust and Credibility,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956708,static/pdfs/A1093_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18062,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1096,The Effect of Moderation on Online Mental Health Conversations,David Wadden|Tal August|Qisheng Li|Tim Althoff,"Many people struggling with mental health issues are unable to access adequate care due to high costs and a shortage of mental health professionals, leading to a global mental health crisis. Online mental health communities can help mitigate this crisis by offering a scalable, easily accessible alternative to in-person sessions with therapists or support groups. However, people seeking emotional or psychological support online may be especially vulnerable to the kinds of antisocial behavior that sometimes occur in online discussions. Moderation can improve online discourse quality, but we lack an understanding of its effects on online mental health conversations.In this work, we leveraged a natural experiment, occurring across 200,000 messages from 7,000 online mental health conversations, to evaluate the effects of moderation on online mental health discussions. We found that participation in group mental health discussions led to improvements in psychological perspective, and that these improvements were larger in moderated conversations. The presence of a moderator increased user engagement, encouraged users to discuss negative emotions more candidly, and dramatically reduced bad behavior among chat participants. Moderation also encouraged stronger linguistic coordination, which is indicative of trust building. In addition, moderators who remained active in conversations were especially successful in keeping conversations on topic. Our findings suggest that moderation can serve as a valuable tool to improve the efficacy and safety of online mental health conversations. Based on these findings, we discuss implications and trade-offs involved in designing effective online spaces for mental health support.","Psychological, personality-based and ethnographic studies of social media|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic recognitio",Full Paper,S2,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-10,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956709,static/pdfs/A1096_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18100,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30

Nevertheless, there is still an important lack of interdisciplinary and empirical research applying social theories to the field of AI. We here aim to shed light on the interactions between humans and autonomous systems and analyse the moral conventions, which underly these interactions and cause moments of conflict and cooperation. For this purpose we employ the Economics of Convention (EC), originally developed in the context of economic processes of production and management involving humans, objects and machines. We create a dataset from three relevant text sources and perform a qualitative exploration of its content. Then, we train a combination of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers on this dataset, which achieve an average classification accuracy of 83.7%. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the predicted conventions reveals, inter alia, that the Industrial and Inspired conventions tend to co-exist in the AI domain. 
 This is the first time, ML classifiers are used to study the EC in different AI-related text types.

In this work, we demonstrate that people tend to follow routines on the Web, and these repetitive patterns of web visits increase their browsing behavior's achievable predictability. We present an information-theoretic framework for measuring the uncertainty and theoretical limits of predictability of human mobility on the Web. We systematically assess the impact of different design decisions on the measurement. We apply the framework to a web tracking dataset of German internet users. Our empirical results highlight that individual's routines on the Web make their browsing behavior predictable to 85% on average, though the value varies across individuals. We observe that these differences in the users' predictabilities can be explained to some extent by their demographic and behavioral attributes.","Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting|New social media applications|interfaces|interaction techniques|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.|Social media usage on mobile devices|location, human mobility, and behav",Full Paper,P5,User Dynamics,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956711,static/pdfs/A1099_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18064,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1101,Group Link Prediction Using Conditional Variational Autoencoder,Hao Sha|Mohammad Al Hasan|George Mohler,"Though link prediction is a well-studied problem with a large body of solutions, existing methods do not handle the case where the predicted link is between an individual and a group. This limitation prevents link prediction models from being directly applicable to many real-life prediction problems where more than two individuals are involved. Examples of such problems include: finding missing members of a group, soliciting new members to join a group, or recommending a group for a person to join. The central aspect of all of the above problems is predicting linkage between a group and an individual, a task we refer to as group link prediction. In this work we propose an innovative method for solving group link prediction consisting of two complementary models: group-to-individual-link (member-recommendation) and individual-to-group-link (group-recommendation). Both of the proposed models use a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) for solving the respective task. For a given individual (or group), the model learns a conditional probability distribution of a link for each candidate group (or individual) link. We compare our proposed model and a collection of competing models on various real-world datasets and show the superior performance of the proposed model in group link prediction.",Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Trust|reputation|recommendation systems|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting,Full Paper,P15,Social Networks,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956712,static/pdfs/A1101_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18092,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1103,Automatic Discovery of Political Meme Genres with Diverse Appearances,William Theisen|Joel Brogan|Pamela Bilo Thomas|Daniel Moreira|Pascal Phoa|Tim Weninger|Walter Scheirer,"Forms of human communication are not static --- we expect some evolution in the way information is conveyed over time because of advances in technology. One example of this phenomenon is the image-based meme, which has emerged as a dominant form of political messaging in the past decade. While originally used to spread jokes on social media, memes are now having an outsized impact on public perception of world events. 
 A significant challenge in automatic meme analysis has been the development of a strategy to match memes from within a single genre when the appearances of the images vary. Such variation is especially common in memes exhibiting mimicry. For example, when voters perform a common hand gesture to signal their support for a candidate. In this paper we introduce a scalable automated visual recognition pipeline for discovering political meme genres of diverse appearance. This pipeline can ingest meme images from a social network, apply computer vision-based techniques to extract local features and index new images into a database, and then organize the memes into related genres. To validate this approach, we perform a large case study on the 2019 Indonesian Presidential Election using a new dataset of over two million images collected from Twitter and Instagram. Results show that this approach can discover new meme genres with visually diverse images that share common stylistic elements, paving the way forward for further work in semantic analysis and content attribution.","Studies of digital humanities (culture, history, arts) using social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting|Organizational and group behavior mediated by social media|interpe",Full Paper,P7,Memes and Misinfo,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956713,static/pdfs/A1103_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18097,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1108,Textual Analysis and Timely Detection of Suspended Social Media Accounts,Dominic Seyler|Shulong Tan|Dingcheng Li|Jingyuan Zhang|Ping Li,"Suspended accounts are high-risk accounts that violate the rules of a social network. These accounts contain spam, offensive and explicit language, among others, and are incredibly variable in terms of textual content. In this work, we perform a detailed linguistic and statistical analysis into the textual information of suspended accounts and show how insights from our study significantly improve a deep-learning-based detection framework. Moreover, we investigate the utility of advanced topic modeling for the automatic creation of word lists that can discriminate suspended from regular accounts. Since early detection of these high-risk accounts is crucial, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art classification models along the temporal dimension by measuring the minimum amount of textual signal needed to perform reliable predictions. Further, we show that the best performing models are able to detect suspended accounts earlier than the social media platform.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Credibility of online content|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic",Full Paper,P13,Misinformation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956714,static/pdfs/A1108_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18091,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1121,Multilayer Graph Association Rules for Link Prediction,Michele Coscia|Michael Szell,"Multiplex networks allow us to study a variety of complex systems where nodes connect to each other in multiple ways, for example friend, family, and co-worker relations in social networks. Link prediction is the branch of network analysis allowing us to forecast the future status of a network: which new connections are the most likely to appear in the future? In multilayer link prediction we also ask: in which layer? Because this last question is unanswerable with classical link prediction, here we investigate the use of graph association rules to inform multilayer link prediction. We derive such rules by identifying all frequent patterns in a network via multilayer graph mining, and then score each unobserved link's likelihood by finding the occurrences of each rule in the original network. Association rules add new abilities to multilayer link prediction: to predict new node arrivals, to consider higher order structures with four or more nodes, and to be memory efficient. In our experiments, we show that, exploiting graph association rules, we are able to achieve a prediction performance close to an ideal ensemble classifier. Further, we perform a case study on a signed multilayer network, showing how graph association rules can provide valuable insights to extend social balance theory.",Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery,Full Paper,P4,Networks,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956715,static/pdfs/A1121_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18047,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1146,"Perceptions of Retrospective Edits, Changes, and Deletion on Social Media",Günce Su Yılmaz|Fiona Gasaway|Blase Ur|Mainack Mondal,"Many social media sites permit users to delete, edit, anonymize, or otherwise modify past posts. These mechanisms enable users to protect their privacy, but also to essentially change the past. We investigate perceptions of the necessity and acceptability of these mechanisms. Drawing on boundary-regulation theories of privacy, we first identify how users who reshared or responded to a post could be impacted by its retrospective modification. These mechanisms can cause boundary turbulence by recontextualizing past content and limiting accountability. In contrast, not permitting modification can lessen privacy and perpetuate harms of regrettable content. To understand how users perceive these mechanisms, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews. Participants deemed retrospective modification crucial for fixing past mistakes. Nonetheless, they worried about the potential for deception through selective changes or removal. Participants were aware retrospective modification impacts others, yet felt these impacts could be minimized through context-aware usage of markers and proactive notifications.",Human computer interaction|social media tools|navigation and visualization,Full Paper,P6,Privacy and Moderation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956716,static/pdfs/A1146_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18108,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1156,X-Posts Explained: Analyzing and Predicting Controversial Contributions in Thematically Diverse Reddit Forums,Anna Guimarães|Gerhard Weikum,"Most online discussion forums capture user feedback in the form of \""likes'' and other similar signals, but limit this to positive feedback. A few forums, most notably Reddit, offer both upvotes and downvotes. Reddit posts that received a large number of both upvotes and downvotes receive an explicit \""controversiality'' marker, while heavily downvoted posts are hidden from the standard view of the discussion, and only shown upon explicit clicks.

This paper aims at understanding the nature and role of controversial posts in Reddit, considering four subreddits of very different natures: US politics, World politics, Relationships and Soccer. We design a feature space and devise a classifier to predict the occurrence of a controversial post given a prefix of a path in a discussion thread. Our findings include that these classifiers exhibit different behaviors in the four subreddits, and we identify key features for the respective cases. An in-depth analysis indicates that controversial posts do not arise as troll-like behavior, but are often due to a polarizing topic (mostly in US politics), off-topic content, or mentions of individual entities such as soccer players or clubs.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Centrality/influence of social media publications and authors|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behav",Full Paper,P14,Text and Bias,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956717,static/pdfs/A1156_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18050,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34

Although automated methods exist for the analysis of various forms of media bias, language is still an important barrier toward spotting worldwide differences in reporting. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on word embeddings, lexicon translation, and document similarity to assess media bias in news articles published in different idioms. We model media bias under the perspective of subjective language use, i.e., the more subjective the content of a news article is, the more biased it is. Our core assumption is that news articles reporting the same events, but written in different languages, should have similar levels of subjectivity; otherwise, we may have spotted biased text. Our method consists of using translated versions of subjectivity lexicons that were originally constructed for measuring subjectivity in the Brazilian Portuguese language. We evaluate our approach on two labeled data sets to show that our method is valid and apply our methodology to analyze recent and largely resounded topics, such as the Venezuela crisis and Syrian war, on four distinct idioms: Portuguese, German, English, and Spanish.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior",Full Paper,P14,Text and Bias,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956718,static/pdfs/A1171_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18084,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34

A1174,Discovering and Categorising Language Biases in Reddit,Xavier Ferrer|Tom Van Nuenen|Jose M. Such|Natalia Criado,"We present a data-driven approach using word embeddings to discover and categorise language biases on the discussion platform Reddit. As spaces for isolated user communities, platforms such as Reddit are increasingly connected to issues of racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination, signalling the need to monitor the language of these groups. One of the most promising AI approaches to trace linguistic biases in large textual datasets involves word embeddings, which transform text into high-dimensional dense vectors and capture semantic relations between words. Yet, previous studies require predefined sets of potential biases to study, e.g., whether gender is more or less associated with particular types of jobs. This makes these approaches unfit to deal with smaller and community-centric datasets such as those on Reddit, which contain smaller vocabularies and slang, as well as biases that may be particular to that community. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to automatically discover language biases encoded in the vocabulary of online discourse communities on Reddit. In our approach, protected attributes are connected to evaluative words found in the data, which are then categorised through a semantic analysis system. We verify the effectiveness of our method by comparing the biases we discover in the Google News dataset with those found in previous literature. We then successfully discover gender bias, religion bias, and ethnic bias in different Reddit communities. We conclude by discussing potential application scenarios and limitations of this data-driven bias discovery method.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analy",Full Paper,P14,Text and Bias,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956720,static/pdfs/A1174_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18048,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1178,"“Call me sexist, but...” : Revisiting Sexism Detection Using Psychological Scales and Adversarial Samples",Mattia Samory|Indira Sen|Julian Kohne|Fabian Flöck|Claudia Wagner,"Research has focused on automated methods to effectively detect sexism online. Although overt sexism seems easy to spot, its subtle forms and manifold expressions are not. In this paper, we outline the different dimensions of sexism by grounding them in their implementation in psychological scales. From the scales, we derive a codebook for sexism in social media, which we use to annotate existing and novel datasets, surfacing their limitations in breadth and validity with respect to the construct of sexism. Next, we leverage the annotated datasets to generate adversarial examples, and test the reliability of sexism detection methods. Results indicate that current machine learning models pick up on a very narrow set of linguistic markers of sexism and do not generalize well to out-of-domain examples. Yet, including diverse data and adversarial examples at training time results in models that generalize better and that are more robust to artifacts of data collection.

Despite its importance of writing a compelling message in sharing articles, the research community does not own a sufficient understanding of what kinds of editing strategies effectively promote audience engagement. In this study, we aim to fill the gap by analyzing media outlets' current practices using a data-driven approach. We first build a parallel corpus of original news articles and their corresponding tweets that eight media outlets shared. Then, we explore how those media edited tweets against original headlines and the effects of such changes. To estimate the effects of editing news headlines for social media sharing in audience engagement, we present a systematic analysis that incorporates a causal inference technique with deep learning; using propensity score matching, it allows for estimating potential (dis-)advantages of an editing style compared to counterfactual cases where a similar news article is shared with a different style. According to the analyses of various editing styles, we report common and differing effects of the styles across the outlets. To understand the effects of various editing styles, media outlets could apply our easy-to-use tool by themselves.","Analysis of the relationship between social media and mainstream media|Credibility of online content|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.",Full Paper,P2,Patterns in User Attention,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956722,static/pdfs/A1180_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18078,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34

Janina Sarol|Ly Dinh|Jana Diesner,"The increasing amount of information available about crisis events calls for tools that help people to efficiently and reliably sift through and summarize this information. When using such tools, practitioners have to make choices that can affect not only the relevant information retrieved, but also their understanding or situational awareness of a crisis. We present a study that assesses the impact of some of these choices on the resulting situational awareness information. We focus on commonly used sources (news, tweets, and blogs), text mining methods (topic modeling and text summarization), and a disaster-related text mining task (needs detection). Our main application context is the 2010 Haiti earthquake, supplemented by data about 11 other events. Our results show that situational awareness information retrieved about the same crisis event can be different or even conflicting based on these choices. We also found that analyzing news data can be helpful in aiding response efforts as they contain unique situational awareness information not found in other considered sources, including first-responder accounts.",Analysis of the relationship between social media and mainstream media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Credibility of online content,Full Paper,P3,NLP,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956723,static/pdfs/A1184_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18087,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1188,Cannot Predict Comment Volume of a News Article before (a few) Users Read It,Lihong He|Chen Shen|Arjun Mukherjee|Slobodan Vucetic|Eduard Dragut,"Many news outlets allow users to contribute comments on topics about daily world events. News articles are the seeds that spring users' interest to contribute content, i.e., comments. An article may attract an apathetic user engagement (several tens of comments) or a spontaneous fervent user engagement (thousands of comments). In this paper, we study the problem of predicting the total number of user comments a news article will receive. Our main insight is that user-to-user interaction factors contribute the most to an accurate prediction, while news article specific factors have surprisingly little influence. This appears to be an interesting and understudied phenomenon: collective social behavior at a news outlet shapes user response and may even downplay the content of an article. We compile and analyze a large number of features, both old and novel from literature. The features span a broad spectrum of facets including news article and comment contents, temporal dynamics, sentiment/linguistic features, and user behaviors. We show that the early arrival rate of comments is the best indicator of the eventual number of comments. We conduct an in-depth analysis of this feature across several dimensions, such as news outlets and news article categories. We show that the relationship between the early rate and the final number of comments as well as the prediction accuracy vary considerably across news outlets and news article categories (e.g., politics, sports, or health).","Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and health|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.",Full Paper,P2,Patterns in User Attention,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956724,static/pdfs/A1188_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18051,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34

Papalexakis,"Can the look and the feel of a website give information about the trustworthiness of an article? In this paper, we propose to use a promising, yet neglected aspect in detecting the misinformativeness: the overall look of the domain web page. To capture this overall look, we take screenshots of news articles served by either misinformative or trustworthy web domains and leverage a tensor decomposition based semi-supervised classification technique.
 The proposed approach i.e., VizFake is insensitive to a number of image transformations such as converting the image to grayscale, vectorizing the image and losing some parts of the screenshots. VizFake leverages a very small amount of known labels, mirroring realistic and practical scenarios, where labels (especially for known misinformative articles), are scarce and quickly become dated. The F1 score of VizFake on a dataset of 50k screenshots of news articles spanning more than 500 domains is roughly 85% using only 5% of ground truth labels. Furthermore, tensor representations of VizFake, obtained in an unsupervised manner, allow for exploratory analysis of the data that provides valuable insights into the problem.
 Finally, we compare VizFake with deep transfer learning, since it is a very popular black-box approach for image classification and also well-known text based methods. VizFake achieves competitive accuracy with deep transfer learning models while being two orders of magnitude faster and not requiring laborious hyper-parameter tuning.",Web and Social Media,Full Paper,P13,Misinformation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956726,static/pdfs/A1216_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18036,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1226,Political Depolarization of News Articles Using Attribute-Aware Word Embeddings,Ruibo Liu|Lili Wang|Chenyan Jia|Soroush Vosoughi,"Political polarization in the US is on the rise. This polarization negatively affects the public sphere by contributing to the creation of ideological echo chambers. In this paper, we focus on addressing one of the factors that contributes to this polarity, polarized media. We introduce a framework for depolarizing news articles. Given an article on a certain topic with a particular ideological slant (eg., liberal or conservative), the framework first detects polar language in the article and then generates a new article with the polar language replaced with neutral expressions. To detect polar words, we train a multi-attribute-aware word embedding model that is aware of ideology and topics on 360k full-length media articles. Then, for text generation, we propose a new algorithm called Text Annealing Depolarization Algorithm (TADA). TADA retrieves neutral expressions from the word embedding model that not only decrease ideological polarity but also preserve the original argument of the text while maintaining grammatical correctness. We evaluate our framework by comparing the depolarized output of our model in two modes, fully-automatic and semi-automatic, on 99 stories spanning 11 topics. Based on feedback from 161 human testers, our framework successfully depolarized 90.1% of paragraphs in semi-automatic mode and 78.3% of paragraphs in fully-automatic mode. Furthermore, 81.2% of the testers agree that the non-polar content information is well-preserved and 79% agree that depolarization does not harm semantic correctness when they compare the original text and the depolarized text. Our work shows that data-driven methods can help to locate political polarity and aid in the depolarization of articles.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Trust|reputation|recommendation systems|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Measuring predi",Full Paper,P14,Text and Bias,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956727,static/pdfs/A1226_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18069,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1236,MILE: A Multi-Level Framework for Scalable Graph Embedding,Jiongqian Liang|Saket Gurukar|Srinivasan Parthasarathy,"Recently there has been a surge of interest in designing graph embedding methods. Few, if any, can scale to a large-sized graph with millions of nodes due to both computational complexity and memory requirements. In this paper, we relax this limitation by introducing the MultI-Level Embedding (MILE) framework – a generic methodology allowing contemporary graph embedding methods to scale to large graphs. MILE repeatedly coarsens the graph into smaller ones using a hybrid matching technique to maintain the backbone structure of the graph. It then applies existing embedding methods on the coarsest graph and refines the embeddings to the original graph through a graph convolution neural network that it learns. The proposed MILE framework is agnostic to the underlying graph embedding techniques and can be applied to many existing graph embedding methods without modifying them. We employ our framework on several popular graph embedding techniques and conduct embedding for real-world graphs. Experimental results on five large-scale datasets demonstrate that MILE significantly boosts the speed (order of magnitude) of graph embedding while generating embeddings of better quality, for the task of node classification. MILE can comfortably scale to a graph with 9 million nodes and 40 million edges, on which existing methods run out of memory or take too long to compute on a modern workstation.

 the diffusion as a mixture of Independent Cascade models

 and derive unsupervised inference techniques for parameter
 estimation of the diffusion mixture model from observed, unlabeled
 cascades. Users influential in the propagation of true

 dynamics. Characteristics of the identified influential users
 reveal positive correlation between influential users identified
 for fake news and their relative appearance in fake news cascades.
 Identified influential users tend to be related to topics
 of more viral information cascades than less viral ones; and
 identified fake news influential users have relatively fewer

A1252,On Predicting Personal Values of Social Media Users using Community-Specific Language Features and Personal Value Correlation,Amila Silva|Pei-Chi Lo|Ee Peng Lim,"Personal values have significant influence on individuals' behaviors, preferences, and decision making.  It is therefore not a surprise that personal values of a person could influence his or her social media content and activities. Instead of getting users to complete personal value questionnaire, researchers have looked into a non-intrusive and highly scalable approach to predict personal values using user-generated social media data. Nevertheless, geographical differences in word usage and profile information are issues to be addressed when designing such prediction models. In this work, we focus on analyzing Singapore users' personal values, and developing effective models to predict their personal values using their Facebook data. These models leverage on word categories in Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and correlations among personal values. The LIWC word categories are adapted to non-English word use in Singapore. We incorporate the correlations among personal values into our proposed Stack Model consisting of a task-specific layer of base models and a cross stitch layer model. Through experiments, we show that our proposed model predicts personal values with considerable improvement of accuracy over the previous works. Moreover, we use the stack model to predict the personal values of a large community of Twitter users using their public tweet content and empirically derive several interesting findings about their online behavior consistent with earlier findings in the social science and social media literature.","Psychological, personality-based and ethnographic studies of social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social",Full Paper,P16,Computation and Psychology,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956730,static/pdfs/A1252_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18094,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34

During the election period, the Turkish people extensively shared their political opinions on Twitter.

In this paper, we present an unsupervised method for target-specific stance detection in a polarized setting, specifically Turkish politics, achieving 90% precision in identifying user stances, while maintaining more than 80% recall. The method involves representing users in an embedding space using Google's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based multilingual universal sentence encoder. The representations are then projected onto a lower dimensional space in a manner that reflects similarities and are consequently clustered. We show the effectiveness of our method in properly clustering users of divergent groups across multiple targets that include political figures, different groups, and parties.

A1006,"Which Node Attribute Prediction Task Are We Solving? Within-Network, Across-Network, or Across-Layer Tasks",Kristen M. Altenburger|Johan Ugander,"Node attribute prediction tasks arise in a wide range of classification tasks on social networks. Examples include detecting spam accounts, identifying compromised accounts, and inferring user demographics for targeted marketing. Despite the prevalence of these types of tasks in machine learning and social science settings, clear problem definitions are lacking. Do all nodes have to be connected in a single network instance? What if there are labels in one network but not another? In this work, we propose a taxonomy that distinguishes between different node attribute prediction tasks; we formalize the existing distinction between within-network and across-network attribute prediction, which have been informally described in prior work, and also introduce a variation we call across-layer attribute prediction. With this framework in place, we observe that methods framed as applicable to across-network tasks have a history of being evaluated on across-layer problem instances. While the methods do well in the across-layer setting, we find that when evaluated in genuine across-network settings, performance can be more limited than previously suggested. We provide a way to analyze and possibly reconcile this predictive performance gap, and highlight why across-network prediction remains an important and open problem domain.",Web and Social Media,Full Paper,S1,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-09,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956732,static/pdfs/A1006_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18039,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30

While some conversational discourse parsing frameworks are available, they do not naturally lend themselves to the analysis of contentious and polarizing discussions. Inspired by the Bakhtinian theory of Dialogism, we propose a novel theoretical and computational framework, better suited for non-convergent discussions. We redefine the measure of a successful discussion, and develop a novel discourse annotation schema which reflects a hierarchy of discursive strategies.  We consider an array of classification models -- from Logistic Regression to BERT. We also consider various feature types and representations, e.g., LIWC categories, standard embeddings, conversational sequences, and non-conversational discourse markers learnt separately. Given the 31 labels in the tagset, an average F-Score of 0.61 is achieved if we allow a different model for each tag, and 0.526 with a single model. The promising results achieved in annotating discussions according to the proposed schema paves the way for a number of downstream tasks and applications such as early detection of discussion trajectories, active moderation of open discussions, and teacher-assistive bots.

A1106,Experience-Driven Peer Effects: Evidence from a Large Natural Experiment,William Cai|Johan Ugander,"Social interactions between people are a central mechanism by which behavior spreads. Several field studies have shown how observing peer behavior affects ones own behavior in a wide range of domains including health, information diffusion, advertisement, and education. However, the role of observing peer experience or outcome---the reward for the observed peer behavior---has largely gone uninvestigated. Here we examine evidence from a large-scale online setting, game play records from League of Legends match-ups, where we are able to disentangle the effects of observing peer behavior from observing peer experience. We find that in addition to positive peer effects from observing behavior, the effect is accentuated by observed experience, with a large positive effect when observing a good outcome and a small (but still positive) effect when observing a bad outcome. We further find that this experience driven effect is moderated by skill, becoming more pronounced among highly skilled subjects. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the role of observed peer experience beyond peer behavior. We anticipate this result to be of use to both practitioners and theoreticians in the space of social influence. For example, online platforms may wish to broadcast the positive outcomes of peers, more than mere behaviors, when a user performs a behavior desirable to the platform.

It was used by members of the alt-right, white supremacists and internet trolls to tag people of Jewish heritage - a modern incarnation of the infamous yellow badge (Judenstern) used in Nazi-Germany. Tracking this trending meme, its meaning, and its function has proved elusive for its semantic ambiguity (e.g., a symbol for a virtual hug). 

In this paper we report of the construction of an appropriate dataset allowing the reconstruction of networks of racist communities and the way they are embedded in the broader community. We combine natural language processing and structural network analysis to study communities promoting hate. In order to overcome dog-whistling and linguistic ambiguity, we propose a multi-modal neural architecture based on a BERT transformer and a BiLSTM network on the tweet level, while also taking into account the users ego-network and meta features. Our multi-modal neural architecture outperforms a set of strong baselines. We further show how the use of language and network structure in tandem allows the detection of the leaders of the hate communities. We further study the \""intersectionality\"" of hate and show that the antisemitic echo correlates with hate speech that targets other minority and protected groups.

 To that effect, various behavioral norms are recommended to new entrants and those seeking to increase their popularity and success.
 Chiefly among them are to simply put in the effort and promote on social media outlets such as Twitter, Instagram, and the like. 
 But does following these behaviors indeed have a relationship with eventual popularity?
 
 In this paper, we collect a corpus of Twitch streamer popularity measures---spanning social and financial measures---and their behavior data on Twitch and third party platforms. We also compile a set of community-defined behavioral norms. We then perform temporal analysis to identify the increased predictive value that a streamer's future behavior contributes to predicting future popularity. At the population level, we find that behavioral information improves the prediction of relative growth that exceeds that of the median streamer. At the individual level, we find that although it is difficult to quickly become successful in absolute terms, streamers that put in considerable effort are more successful than the rest.

A1214,An Analysis of Replies to Trump’s Tweets,Zijian An|Kenneth Joseph,"Donald Trump has tweeted thousands of times during his presidency. These public statements are an increasingly important way through which Trump communicates his political and personal views. A better understanding of the way the American public consumes and responds to these tweets is therefore critical. In the present work, we address both consumption of and response to Trump's tweets by studying replies to them on Twitter. With respect to response, we find that a small number of older, white, left-leaning, and female Americans are responsible for the vast majority of replies to Trump's tweets. These individuals also attend to a broader range of Trump's tweets than the rest of the individuals we study. With respect to consumption, we note that Trump's tweets are often viewed not in isolation, but rather in the context of a set of algorithmically-curated replies. These replies may therefore color the way Americans consume Trump's tweets. To this end, we find some evidence that Twitter accounts see replies in line with their political leanings. However, we show that this can be largely, although not entirely, attributed to the fact that Twitter is more likely to show replies by accounts a user follows. As a basis for comparison, all results for Trump are compared and contrasted with replies to Joe Biden's tweets.",Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Organizational and group behavior mediated by social media|interpersonal communication mediated by social media,Full Paper,P1,Politics and Trump,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956737,static/pdfs/A1214_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18040,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
A1273,The Healthy States of America: Creating a Health Taxonomy with Social Media,Sanja Šćepanović|Luca Maria Aiello|Ke Zhou|Sagar Joglekar|Daniele Quercia,"Since the uptake of social media, researchers have mined online discussions to track the outbreak and evolution of specific diseases or chronic conditions such as influenza or depression. To broaden the set of diseases under study, we developed a Deep Learning tool for Natural Language Processing that extracts mentions of virtually any medical condition or disease from unstructured social media text. With that tool at hand, we processed Reddit and Twitter posts, analyzed the clusters of the two resulting co-occurrence networks of conditions, and discovered that they correspond to well-defined categories of medical conditions. This resulted in the creation of the first comprehensive taxonomy of medical conditions automatically derived from online discussions. We validated the structure of our taxonomy against the official International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), finding matches of our clusters with 20 official categories, out of 22. Based on the mentions of our taxonomy's sub-categories on  Reddit posts geo-referenced in the U.S., we were then able to compute disease-specific health scores. As opposed to counts of disease mentions or counts with no knowledge of our taxonomy's structure, we found that our disease-specific health scores are causally linked with the officially reported prevalences of 18 conditions.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Credibility of online content|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and health",Full Paper,P8,Applications,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956738,static/pdfs/A1273_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18089,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
B1018,Understanding the Invitation Acceptance in Agent-initiated Social E-commerce,Fengli Xu|Guozhen Zhang|Yuan Yuan|Hongjia Huang|Diyi Yang|Depeng Jin|Yong Li,"Recent years have witnessed the phenomenal success of a new form of social e-commerce platforms, which transforms users into agents by motivating them with monetary rewards to promote products and invite new agents through their social network. Despite their rapid growth, there is still inadequate evidence on how such agent invitation works. This research examines what factors affect the agent invitation process. We first conduct a qualitative user study, where we identify four potential mechanisms related to the agent invitation: social conformity, social enrichment, refusal avoidance, and benefit-cost trade-off. Leveraging the empirical data collected from one of the largest social e-commerce platforms in China - Beidian, we operationalize a set of behavioral indicators of these mechanisms and further develop machine learning models to predict users' reactions to invitations. We found that the identified four mechanisms contribute to the high success rate of agent invitations differently. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and their potential benefits to real-world applications.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|New social media applications|interfaces|interaction techniques|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.|Organizational and group behavior mediated by social media|interpersonal commu",Full Paper,S2,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-10,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956739,static/pdfs/B1018_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18106,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30
B1022,Expertise and Dynamics within Crowdsourced Musical Knowledge Curation: A Case Study of the Genius Platform,Derek Lim|Austin R. Benson,"Many platforms collect crowdsourced information primarily from volunteers. As this type of knowledge curation has become widespread, contribution formats vary substantially and are driven by diverse processes across differing platforms. Thus, models for one platform are not necessarily applicable to others. Here, we study the temporal dynamics of Genius, a platform mainly designed for user-contributed annotations of song lyrics. A unique aspect of Genius is that the annotations are extremely local --- an annotated lyric may just be a few lines of a song --- but also highly related, e.g., by song, album, artist, or genre.

We analyze several dynamical processes associated with lyric annotations and their edits, which differ substantially from models for other platforms.  For example, expertise on song annotations follows a \""U shape\"" where experts are both early and late contributors with non-experts contributing intermediately; we develop a user utility model that offers one possible explanation for such behavior. We also find several traits appearing early in a user's lifespan of contributions that distinguish (eventual) experts from non-experts. Combining our findings, we develop a model for early prediction of user expertise.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.",Full Paper,P11,Demographic (Dis)parities,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956740,static/pdfs/B1022_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18068,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34

A growing body of research has identified unfair AI systems and proposed methods to debias them, yet many challenges remain. Representation learning methods for Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), fundamental building blocks used in complex network mining, have socially consequential applications such as automated career counseling, but there have been few attempts to ensure that it will not encode or amplify harmful biases, e.g. sexism in the job market.  To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive set of de-biasing methods for fair HINs representation learning, including sampling-based, projection-based, and graph neural networks (GNNs)-based techniques.  We systematically study the behavior of these algorithms, especially their capability in balancing the trade-off between fairness and prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in an automated career counseling application where we mitigate gender bias in career recommendation. Based on the evaluation results on two datasets, we identify the most effective fair HINs representation learning techniques under different conditions.","Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and health",Full Paper,P4,Networks,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956741,static/pdfs/B1057_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18111,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
B1009,Deception Detection in Group Video Conversations using Dynamic Interaction Networks,Srijan Kumar|Chongyang Bai|V.s. Subrahmanian|Jure Leskovec,"Predicting groups of people who are jointly deceptive is critical in settings such as sales pitches and negotiations. Past work on deception in videos focuses on detecting single deceivers and uses facial or visual features only. We propose the concept of Face-to Face Interaction Networks (FFINs) and Negative Interaction Networks (NINs) to model interactions within a group of people. The use of FFINs and NINs in this paper enables us to leverage network relations in predicting face-to-face deception for the first time. We will use a dataset of 185 videos from a deception-based game called Resistance for deception based prediction using FFINs. We first characterize the behavior of individuals, pairs, and groups of deceptive participants compared to non-deceptive participants. Our analysis reveals that less engaged deceivers are identified early. Moreover, pairs of deceivers tend to avoid mutual interaction and focus their attention on non-deceivers. In contrast, non-deceivers interact with everyone equally. We propose the notion of Negative Interaction Networks (NINs) and create a belief propagation neural net algorithm called BPNN based on dynamic FFINs and NINs to detect deceivers from videos that are just 1 minute long. We show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art computer vision, graph embedding, and ensemble methods by at least 20.9% AUROC in identifying deception from videos.",Trust|reputation|recommendation systems|New social media applications|interfaces|interaction techniques|Organizational and group behavior mediated by social media|interpersonal communication mediated by social media,Full Paper,P13,Misinformation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956742,static/pdfs/B1009_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18065,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

We present evaluation results and analysis from multiple controlled crowdsourced studies. For a deeper understanding of Explainable AI systems, we discuss interactions between user engagement, mental model, trust, and performance measures in the process of explaining.

B1037,Social Facilitation Among Gamblers: A Large-Scale Study Using Account-Based Data,Niklas Hopfgartner|Tiago Santos|Michael Auer|Mark Griffiths|Denis Helic,"Previous research suggests that the presence of other gamblers in a gambling venue intensifies individual gambling behavior. To study such potential social facilitation among gamblers, we conduct a large-scale analysis of more than one million gambling sessions using player tracking data of the Norwegian gambling operator Norsk Tipping. In particular, we empirically assess the existence and strength of this facilitation, and how it manifests in differently utilized gambling venues. In our study, we control for (i) each individual's co-gamblers (frequent vs. occasional co-gamblers) and for (ii) the magnitude of individual's social participation (social seeking vs. social avoiding gamblers). We find that gamblers stake more money and play longer sessions the more crowded the venues get and that social avoiding gamblers gamble more when they play with their most-frequent co-gambler. Interestingly, our results strongly indicate that social avoiding gamblers are more susceptible to social facilitation than gamblers who are familiar with crowded gambling venues. Overall, our research is the first large-scale study of social facilitation among gamblers introducing a novel framework to empirically measure this effect. We believe that our work will have important practical implications for both gambling behavior researchers as well as the gambling industry in designing and evaluating responsible gambling tools.","Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.",Full Paper,S2,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-10,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956744,static/pdfs/B1037_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18052,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30
B1059,Political Polarization in Online News Consumption,Kiran Garimella|Tim Smith|Rebecca Weiss|Robert West,"Political polarization appears to be on the rise, as measured by voting behavior, general affect towards opposing partisans and their parties, and contents posted and consumed online.
Research over the years has focused on the role of the Web as a driver of polarization.
In order to further our understanding of the factors behind online polarization, in the present work we collect and analyze Web browsing histories of tens of thousands of users alongside careful measurements of the time spent browsing various news sources.
We show that online news consumption follows a polarized pattern, where users' visits to news sources aligned with their own political leaning are substantially longer than their visits to other news sources.
Next, we show that such preferences hold at the individual as well as the population level, as evidenced by the emergence of clear partisan communities of news domains from aggregated browsing patterns.
Finally, we tackle the important question of the role of user choices in polarization. Are users simply following the links proffered by their Web environment, or do they exacerbate partisan polarization by intentionally pursuing like-minded news sources?
To answer this question, we compare browsing patterns with the underlying hyperlink structure spanned by the considered news domains, finding strong evidence of polarization in partisan browsing habits beyond that which can be explained by the hyperlink structure of the Web.","Studies of digital humanities (culture, history, arts) using social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and health|Engagemen",Full Paper,S1,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-09,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956745,static/pdfs/B1059_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18049,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30
B1060,You Don't Know How I Feel: Insider-Outsider Perspective Gaps in Cyberbullying Risk Detection,Seunghyun Kim|Afsaneh Razi|Gianluca Stringhini|Pamela J. Wisniewski|Munmun De Choudhury,"Cyberbullying is a prevalent concern within social computing research that has led to the development of several supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms for automated risk detection. A critical aspect of ML algorithm development is how to establish ground truth that is representative of the phenomenon of interest in the real world. Often, ground truth is determined by third-party annotators (i.e., “outsiders”) who are removed from the situational context of the interaction; therefore, they cannot fully understand the perspective of the individuals involved (i.e., “insiders”). To understand the extent of this problem, we compare “outsider” versus “insider” perspectives when annotating 2,000 posts from an online peer-support platform. We interpolate this analysis to a corpus containing over 2.3 million posts on bullying and related topics, and reveal significant gaps in ML models that use third-party annotators to detect bullying incidents. Our results indicate that models based on the insiders’ perspectives yield a significantly higher recall in identifying bullying posts and are able to capture a range of explicit and implicit references and linguistic framings, including person-specific impressions of the incidents. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating the victim’s point of view in establishing effective tools for cyberbullying risk detection. As such, we advocate for the adoption of human-centered and value-sensitive approaches for algorithm development that bridge insider-outsider perspective gaps in a way that empowers the most vulnerable.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Human computer interaction|social media tools|navigation and visualization|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of soc",Full Paper,P8,Applications,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956746,static/pdfs/B1060_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18061,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
B1067,On the Role of Micro-categories to Characterize Event Popularity in Meetup,Ayan Kumar Bhowmick|Soumajit Pramanik|Sayan Pathak|Bivas Mitra,"Event-based social networking platforms such as Meetup have recently witnessed a huge growth. However, with the rise in the volume of groups and events, making individual events attractive has become increasingly challenging for its organizers. As a result, we find that events hosted by groups of same category at similar venues and similar times, also widely differ in their popularity. Data study reveals that the topics specified in textual descriptions of events may be key to their popularity. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of topical micro-categories in the context of EBSNs for accurately characterizing events, such that events belonging to the same micro-category exhibit similar popularity profile. We develop a principled method to detect such micro-categories from the textual descriptions of individual events. Our experiments reveal the significance of the detected micro-categories in determining the popularity of associated Meetup events and groups. We also investigate the effectiveness of the micro-categories in a real-world application scenario by developing a recommendation model; this model recommends relevant micro-categories to a group for hosting its future events with enhanced popularity. Notably, our model achieves an average NDCG score of around 0.75 showing a straight 5% improvement over the best performing competing method.",Ranking/relevance of social media content and users|Trust|reputation|recommendation systems|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification|Organizational and group behavior mediated by social media|interpersonal communi,Full Paper,P12,Economy,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956747,static/pdfs/B1067_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18042,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
B1069,How Medical Crowdfunding Helps People? A Large-scale Case Study on the Waterdrop Fundraising,Junjie Huang|Huawei Shen|Qi Cao|Li Cai|Xueqi Cheng,"While online medical crowdfunding achieved tremendous success, quantitative study about whether and how medical crowdfunding helps people remains little explored. 
In this paper, we empirically study how online medical crowdfunding helps people using more than 27,000 fundraising cases in Waterdrop Fundraising, one of the most popular online medical crowdfunding platforms in China. 
We find that the amount of money obtained by fundraisers is broadly distributed, i.e., a majority of lowly donated cases coexist with a handful of very successful cases. We further investigate the factors that potentially correlate with the success of medical fundraising cases. 
Profile information of fundraising cases, e.g., geographic information of fundraisers, affects the donated amounts, since detailed description may increase the credibility of a fundraising case. 
One prominent finding lies in the effect of social network on the success of fundraising cases: the spread of fundraising information along social network is a key factor of fundraising success, and the social capital of fundraisers play an important role in fundraising. 
Finally, we conduct prediction of donations using machine learning models, verifying the effect of potential factors on the success of medical crowdfunding. 
Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of medical fundraising on the web and opens a door to understanding medical crowdfunding.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and health|New social media applications|interfaces|interaction techniques",Full Paper,P8,Applications,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956748,static/pdfs/B1069_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18055,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34

A longitudinal analysis that combines pageview statistics for 12 Wikipedia language editions with mobility reports published by Apple and Google reveals massive shifts in the volume and the nature of information seeking patterns amidst the pandemic. Interestingly, while we observe a transient increase in Wikipedia's pageviews volume following mobility restrictions, the nature of what people seek for was impacted in the long run. These changes are most pronounced for language editions associated with countries in which the most severe mobility restrictions were implemented. We also find that articles belonging to different topics behaved differently, e.g., attention towards entertainment-related topics is lingering and even increasing, while the interest in health- and biology-related topics was either unsubstantial or transient.

However, little is known about the dependence of temporal patterns of popularity on event-related information, e.g. which types of events trigger long-lasting activity. Here we propose a simple model that describes the dynamics around peaks of popularity by incorporating key features, i.e., the anticipatory growth and the decay of collective attention together with circadian rhythms. The proposed model allows us to develop a new method for predicting the future page view activity and for clustering time series. To validate our methodology, we collect a corpus of page view data from Wikipedia associated to a range of planned events, that are events which we know in advance will have a fixed date in the future, such as elections and sport events. Our methodology is superior to existing models in both prediction and clustering tasks. Furthermore, restricting to Wikipedia pages associated to association football, we observe that the specific realization of the event, in our case which team wins a match or the type of the match, has a significant effect on the response dynamics after the event.

D1064,Cross-Partisan Discussions on YouTube: Conservatives Talk to Liberals but Liberals Don't Talk to Conservatives,Siqi Wu|Paul Resnick,"We present the first large-scale measurement study of cross-partisan discussions between liberals and conservatives on YouTube, based on a dataset of 274,241 political videos from 973 channels of US partisan media and 134M comments from 9.3M users over eight months in 2020. Contrary to a simple narrative of echo chambers, we find a surprising amount of cross-talk: most users with at least 10 comments posted at least once on both left-leaning and right-leaning YouTube channels. Cross-talk, however, was not symmetric. Based on the user leaning predicted by a hierarchical attention model, we find that conservatives were much more likely to comment on left-leaning videos than liberals on right-leaning videos. Secondly, YouTube's comment sorting algorithm made cross-partisan comments modestly less visible; for example, comments from conservatives made up 26.3% of all comments on left-leaning videos but just over 20% of the comments were in the top 20 positions. Lastly, using Perspective API's toxicity score as a measure of quality, we find that conservatives were not significantly more toxic than liberals when users directly commented on the content of videos. However, when users replied to comments from other users, we find that cross-partisan replies were more toxic than co-partisan replies on both left-leaning and right-leaning videos, with cross-partisan replies being especially toxic on the replier's home turf.",Organizational and group behavior mediated by social media|interpersonal communication mediated by social media,Full Paper,S2,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-10,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956751,static/pdfs/D1064_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18105,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30
D1070,"The Media During the Rise of Trump: Identity Politics, Immigration,'Mexican' Demonization and Hate-Crime",Orestis Papakyriakopoulos|Ethan Zuckerman,"In this study, we investigate the role of the US online media ecosystem in Donald Trump’s rise and consolidation to power (2013-2019). We analyze over 54 million articles from online U.S. media and locate a media narrative shift related to three issues that Trump focused on during his 2016 presidential campaign: immigration, Latinx people, and identity politics. Given this, we develop Natural Language Processing techniques based on word embeddings to quantify biased representations of minorities in the media across time.  We locate an increase in biased speech that parallels Trump’s rise to power, and a clear partisan pattern to this bias. Comparing articles related to Latinx, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Jewish Americans, we show that the most biased representations in terms of stereotypes and prejudice are found when the media uses the term \""Mexicans,\""  which Trump used as a blanket term for a diverse Latin and Hispanic population. We develop econometric models to understand the narrative shift and to associate media reporting with real-world dynamics. We find that the media’s focus on the new narratives and the intensity of biased representations are statistically associated with hate-crime incidents at the state level. These results illustrate how media amenability to politicians' agenda-building can result in the discrimination of social groups, as well as how problematic media reporting is linked to real-world harms. Consequently, we reflect on the role of the media as gatekeepers of public discourse and discuss the conditions for a diverse and inclusive media ecosystem.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting",Full Paper,P1,Politics and Trump,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956752,static/pdfs/D1070_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18076,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

D1087,Understanding the Diverging User Trajectories in Highly-related Online Communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic,Jason Shuo Zhang|Brian Keegan|Qin Lv|Chenhao Tan,"As the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting life worldwide, related online communities are popping up. In particular, two “new” communities, /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus, emerged on Reddit and have been dedicated to COVID- related discussions from the very beginning of this pandemic. With /r/Coronavirus promoted as the official community on Reddit, it remains an open question how users choose between these two highly-related communities.

In this paper, we characterize user trajectories in these two communities from the beginning of COVID-19 to the end of September 2020. We show that new users of /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus were similar from January to March. After that, their differences steadily increase, both in language distance and membership prediction, as the pandemic continues to unfold. Furthermore, users who started at /r/China flu from January to March were more likely to leave, while those who started in later months tend to remain highly “loyal”. To understand this difference, we develop a movement analysis framework to understand membership changes in these two communities and identify a significant proportion of /r/China flu members (around 50%) that moved to /r/Coronavirus in February. This movement turns out to be highly predictable based on other subreddits that users were previously active in. Our work demonstrates how two highly-related communities emerge and develop their own identity in a crisis, and highlights the important role of existing communities in understanding such an emergence.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena bas",Full Paper,P5,User Dynamics,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956754,static/pdfs/D1087_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18112,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
D1099,"Political Bias and Factualness in News Sharing across more than 100,000 Online Communities",Galen Weld|Maria Glenski|Tim Althoff,"As civil discourse increasingly takes place online, misinformation and the polarization of news shared in online communities have become ever more relevant concerns with real world harms across our society. Studying online news sharing at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of content which is shared by millions of users across thousands of communities. Therefore, existing research has largely focused on specific communities or specific interventions, such as bans. However, understanding the prevalence and spread of misinformation and polarization more broadly, across thousands of online communities, is critical for the development of governance strategies, interventions, and community design. Here, we conduct the largest study of news sharing on reddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million links spanning 4 years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check to annotate links to news sources with their political bias and factualness. We find that, compared to left-leaning communities, right-leaning communities have 105% more variance in the political bias of their news sources, and more links to relatively-more biased sources, on average. We observe that reddit users’ voting and re-sharing behaviors generally decrease the visibility of extremely biased and low factual content, which receives 20% fewer upvotes and 30% fewer exposures from crossposts than more neutral or more factual content. This suggests that reddit is more resilient to low factual content than Twitter. We show that extremely biased and low factual content is very concentrated, with 99% of such content being shared in only 0.5% of communities, giving credence to the recent strategy of community-wide bans and quarantines.",Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Credibility of online content,Full Paper,S1,Spotlight,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/spotlight,2021-06-09,(13:00-14:00 GMT),38956755,static/pdfs/D1099_highlight.pdf,Spotlight,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18104,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Spotlight+Room&spawnx=16&spawny=30
D1137,Measuring Societal Biases from Text Corpora with Smoothed First-Order Co-occurrence,Navid Rekabsaz|Robert West|James Henderson|Allan Hanbury,"Text corpora are widely used resources for measuring societal biases and stereotypes. The common approach to measuring such biases using a corpus is by calculating the similarities between the embedding vector of a word (like nurse) and the vectors of the representative words of the concepts of interest (such as genders). In this study, we show that, depending on what one aims to quantify as bias, this commonly-used approach can introduce non-relevant concepts into bias measurement. We propose an alternative approach to bias measurement utilizing the smoothed first-order co-occurrence relations between the word and the representative concept words, which we derive by reconstructing the co-occurrence estimates inherent in word embedding models. We compare these approaches by conducting several experiments on the scenario of measuring gender bias of occupational words, according to an English Wikipedia corpus. Our experiments show higher correlations of the measured gender bias with the actual gender bias statistics of the U.S. job market – on two collections and with a variety of word embedding models – using the first-order approach in comparison with the vector similarity-based approaches. The first-order approach also suggests a more severe bias towards female in a few specific occupations than the other approaches.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification",Full Paper,P3,NLP,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956756,static/pdfs/D1137_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18083,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
D1138,'I Won the Election!': An Empirical Analysis of Soft Moderation Interventions on Twitter,Savvas Zannettou,"Over the past few years, there is a heated debate and serious public concerns regarding online content moderation, censorship, and the principle of free speech on the Web. To ease these concerns, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook refined their content moderation systems to support soft moderation interventions. Soft moderation interventions refer to warning labels attached to potentially questionable or harmful content to inform other users about the content and its nature while the content remains accessible, hence alleviating concerns related to censorship and free speech. In this work, we perform one of the first empirical studies on soft moderation interventions on Twitter. Using a mixed-methods approach, we study the users who share tweets with warning labels on Twitter and their political leaning, the engagement that these tweets receive, and how users interact with tweets that have warning labels. Among other things, we find that 72% of the tweets with warning labels are shared by Republicans, while only 11% are shared by Democrats.
By analyzing content engagement, we find that tweets with warning labels had more engagement compared to tweets without warning labels. Also, we qualitatively analyze how users interact with content that has warning labels finding that the most popular interactions are related to further debunking false claims, mocking the author or content of the disputed tweet, and further reinforcing or resharing false claims. Finally, we describe concrete examples of inconsistencies, such as warning labels that are incorrectly added or warning labels that are not added on tweets despite sharing questionable and potentially harmful information.",Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Credibility of online content|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Social innovation and effecting change through social media,Full Paper,P6,Privacy and Moderation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956757,static/pdfs/D1138_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18110,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
D1142,CEAM: The Effectiveness of Cyclic and Ephemeral Attention Models of User Behavior on Social Platforms,Farhan Asif Chowdhury|Yozen Liu|Koustuv Saha|Nicholas Vincent|Leonardo Neves|Neil Shah|Maarten W. Bos,"To improve the user experience as well as business outcomes, social platforms aim to predict user behavior. To this end, recurrent models are often used to predict a user's next behavior based on their most recent behavior. However, people have habits and routines, making it plausible to predict their behavior from more than just their most recent activity. Our work focuses on the interplay between ephemeral and cyclical components of user behaviors. By utilizing user activity data from social platform Snapchat, we uncover cyclic and ephemeral usage patterns on a per user level. Based on our findings, we imbued recurrent models with awareness: we augment an RNN with a cyclic module to complement traditional RNNs that model ephemeral behaviors and allow a flexible weighting of the two for the prediction task. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our model's performance on four user behavior prediction tasks on the Snapchat platform. We achieve improved results on each task compared against existing methods, using this simple, but important insight in user behavior: Both cyclical and ephemeral components matter. We show that in some situations and for some people, ephemeral components may be more helpful for predicting behavior, while for others and in other situations, cyclical components may carry more weight.","Ranking/relevance of social media content and users|Human computer interaction|social media tools|navigation and visualization|Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.|Social media usage on mobile devices|location, human mobility, and b",Full Paper,P2,Patterns in User Attention,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956758,static/pdfs/D1142_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18046,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34

The paper performs, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive analysis on the Indian online news media with respect to tracking and  partisanship. We build a dataset of 103 online, mostly mainstream news websites. With the help of two experts, alongside data from the Media Ownership Monitor, we label these websites according to their partisanship  (Left, Right, or Centre). We study and compare user tracking on these sites with different metrics: numbers of cookies, cookie synchronization, device fingerprinting, and invisible pixel-based tracking. We find that Left and  Centre websites serve more cookies than Right-leaning websites. However, through cookie synchronization, more user IDs are synchronized in Left websites than Right or Centre. Canvas fingerprinting is used similarly by Left and Right,  and  less  by  Centre. Invisible pixel-based tracking is 50% more intense in Centre-leaning websites than Right, and 25% more than Left. Desktop versions of news websites deliver more cookies than their mobile counterparts. A handful of third-parties are tracking users in most websites in this study.

Since Wikipedia data is ubiquitously encountered, it is important to evaluate its coverage of content and identify data gaps that may exist. Here, we evaluate Wikipedia’s coverage of the music domain, which is one of the most popular topics.Particularly,  we  compile  the  most  prominent  50,000  music artists (by streaming popularity on a large online streaming platform) and determine whether each artist has a Wikipedia page. We first show that streaming popularity correlates with Wikipedia representation – while 90% of the top one thousand most popularly streamed artists are on Wikipedia, the chance of being on Wikipedia drops to 50% after the ten thousandth artist. Next, we examine the Wikipedia coverage of artists of different gender and genre, while controlling for popularity.We also examine, for artists that are on Wikipedia, the amount of content, frequency of edits, and Pagerank for their pages.We uncover large differences in representation for artists of different genres; for the same popularity level ,hiphop, latin, and dance/electronic artists are most lacking in representation while rock artists have approximately twice as much representation. With respect to gender, while female artists are under represented in the top of the music industry itself, male artists were less likely represented on Wikipedia relative to the female artists in this study’s top sample, suggesting inter-action with genre and visibility of select superstars.","Studies of digital humanities (culture, history, arts) using social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Social innovation and effecting change through social media",Full Paper,P11,Demographic (Dis)parities,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956762,static/pdfs/E1037_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18101,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34

E1070,Partisan Responses to Fact-Checking in Online News Platforms: Evidence from a Political Rumor about the North Korean Leader,Taeyoung Kang|Jaeung Sim,"To correct misinformation and mitigate the social costs of political rumors and fake news, news providers, politicians, and researchers have exerted significant efforts on fact-checking and rumor debunking. This study examined how individuals will respond when a political rumor is debunked by large-scale fact-checking. To explore this question, we leveraged a quasi-experimental setting where the North Korean leader’s reappearance in the public event suddenly rebutted a political rumor about his death. Collecting 2.6 million comments from the largest online news portal in South Korea, we employed a difference-in-differences approach comparing differences in commenting behaviors between liberals and conservatives before and after this event. The results show that a political side empowered by the fact-checking coverage became more vocal and hostile. However, their explicit support level for the rumor did not change significantly compared to their partisan counterparts. Besides, we found that news outlets rebutted by fact-checking attracted more user comments than supported news outlets. Swearing comments of the supported political side mostly drove this difference, suggesting that partisans tend to utilize favorable fact-checking to empower their political side through blaming the other side. Our research stresses the importance of capturing the silence of partisans in considering the effectiveness of fact-checking and provides an alternative explanation on why fact-checking evokes hostile communication in online media.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior",Full Paper,P7,Memes and Misinfo,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956765,static/pdfs/E1070_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18059,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34

To address this issue, we propose a multi-task audience evaluation model that can assess both the loyalty and authenticity of influencers’ audiences. More specifically, the proposed model takes engagement information of an influencer’s audience, including likes and comments on social media posts, and predicts (i) the retention rate of the audience of the influencer and (ii) how the influencer is associated with fake audiences (or engagement bots). To learn the social interaction between influencers and their audiences, we build multi-relational networks based on the diverse engagement behavior such as commenting. Our model further utilizes the contextualized information captured in user comments to learn distinct engagement behavior of genuine and fake users. Based on the predicted loyalty and authenticity scores, we rank influencers to find those who are followed by loyal and authentic audiences. By using a large-scale Instagram influencer-audience dataset which contains 14,221 influencers, 9,290,895 audiences, and 65,848,717 engagements, we evaluate ranking performance, and show that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline methods.",Centrality/influence of social media publications and authors|Ranking/relevance of social media content and users|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Trust|reputation|recommendation systems,Full Paper,P8,Applications,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956766,static/pdfs/E1089_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18060,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34

However, obtaining high quality sentiment-associated and human interpretable themes still remains a challenge for short texts. In this paper we develop ELJST, an embedding enhanced generative joint sentiment-topic model that can discover more coherent and diverse topics from short texts. It uses Markov Random Field Regularizer that can be seen as generalisation of skip-gram based models. Further, it can leverage higher order semantic information appearing in word embedding, such as self-attention weights in graphical models. Our results show an average improvement of 10% in topic coherence and 5% in topic diversification over baselines. Finally, ELJST helps understand users' behaviour at more granular levels which can be explained.

E1103,Towards Emotion- and Time-Aware Classification of Tweets to Assist Human Moderation for Suicide Prevention,Ramit Sawhney|Harshit Joshi|Alicia Nobles|Rajiv Ratn Shah,"Social media platforms are already engaged in leveraging existing online socio-technical systems to employ just-in-time interventions for suicide prevention to the public. These efforts primarily rely on self-reports of potential self-harm content that is reviewed by moderators. Most recently, platforms have employed automated models to identify self-harm content, but acknowledge that these automated models still struggle to understand the nuance of human language (e.g., sarcasm). By explicitly focusing on Twitter posts that could easily be misidentified by a model as expressing suicidal intent (i.e., they contain similar phrases such as ``wanting to die''), our work examines the temporal differences in historical expressions of general and emotional language prior to a clear expression of suicidal intent. Additionally, we analyze time-aware neural models that build on these language variants and factors in the historical, emotional spectrum of a user's tweeting activity. The strongest model achieves high (statistically significant) performance (macro F1=0.804, recall=0.813) to identify social media indicative of suicidal intent. Using three use cases of tweets with phrases common to suicidal intent, we qualitatively analyze and interpret how such models decided if suicidal intent was present and discuss how these analyses may be used to alleviate the burden on human moderators within the known constraints of how moderation is performed (e.g., no access to the user's timeline). Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of such data-driven models and inferences about suicidal intent from social media.

Connecting a customer's identity on a service with her identity on a different service, known as user identity linkage (UIL), enables a comprehensive understanding of users in a variety of real-world applications. The difficulties of UIL tasks in marketing applications are mainly the lack of user demographics and diverse user behavioral patterns, which differs from UIL tasks in social networking services that previous UIL methods have mainly been used to tackle. In this paper, we propose a novel method for UIL for different behavioral patterns to determine whether two given behavioral histories come from the same user without using any user demographics.

E1113,RAFFMAN: Measuring and Analyzing Sentiment in Online Political Forum Discussions with an Application to the Trump Impeachment,Jakapun Tachaiya|Joobin Gharibshah|Kevin E. Esterling|Michalis Faloutsos,"Given an online forum, how can we quantify changes in user
affect towards a person or an idea over time? We argue that
online political forums constitute an untapped opportunity
for understanding sentiment toward aspects under discussion.
However, the analysis of such forums has received little attention
from the research community. In this paper, we develop
RAFFMAN, a systematic approach to quantify the impact of
external events on the affect of forum users towards a concept,
such as a person or an entity. First, we develop an approach
to capture and quantify the observed activity: we identify related
keywords, filter threads, and establish correlations between
events and spikes in the activity. Second, we modify
and evaluate state-of-the-art NLP techniques to achieve high
accuracy (74%) in a three-class sentiment classification problem.
As a case study, we deploy our method to quantify the
effect of President Trump’s impeachment on several concepts
including: President Trump, Speaker Pelosi, and QAnon. Our
data consists of 32M posts from Reddit and 4chan over a span
of 6 months from September 2019 to February 2020. This initial
analysis hints at an increase in political polarization, especially
for people’s affect towards the President. Overall, our
work is a building block towards mining the affect of online
forum user towards a concept, which constitutes a untapped,
massive, and publicly-available source of information.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning politics, finance, and he",Full Paper,P1,Politics and Trump,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956770,static/pdfs/E1113_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18096,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
E1121,More than Meets the Tie: Examining the Role of Interpersonal Relationships in Social Networks,Minje Choi|Ceren Budak|Daniel M. Romero|David Jurgens,"Topics in conversations depend in part on the type of interpersonal relationship between speakers, such as friendship, kinship, or romance. Identifying these relationships can provide a rich description of how individuals communicate and reveal how relationships influence the way people share information. Using a dataset of more than 9.6M dyads of Twitter users, we show how relationship types influence language use, topic diversity, communication frequencies, and diurnal patterns of conversations. These differences can be used to predict the relationship between two users, with the best predictive model achieving a macro F1 score of 0.70. We also demonstrate how relationship types influence communication dynamics through the task of predicting future retweets. Adding relationships as a feature to a strong baseline model increases the F1 and recall by 1% and 2%. The results of this study suggest relationship types have the potential to provide new insights into how communication and information diffusion occur in social networks.","Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|top",Full Paper,P4,Networks,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-08,(15:30-16:30 GMT),38956771,static/pdfs/E1121_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18045,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
E1133,RecTen: A Recursive Hierarchical Low Rank Tensor Factorization Method to Discover Hierarchical Patterns from Multi-modal Data,Risul Islam|Md Omar Faruk Rokon|Evangelos E. Papalexakis|Michalis Faloutsos,"How can we expand the tensor decomposition to reveal a hierarchical structure of the multi-modal data in a self-adaptive way? Current tensor decomposition provides only a single layer of clusters. We argue that with the abundance of multimodal data and time-evolving networks nowadays, the ability to identify emerging hierarchies is important. To this effect, we propose RecTen, a multi-modal hierarchical clustering approach based on tensor decomposition. Our approach enables us to: (a) recursively decompose clusters identified in the previous step, and (b) identify the right conditions for terminating this process. In the absence of a well-established benchmark, we evaluate our approach with synthetic and five real datasets. First, we test the sensitivity of the performance to different scenarios and parameters. Second, we apply RecTen on four online forums and a dataset that represents user interaction on GitHub. This analysis identifies meaningful and interesting behaviors, which further increases our confidence in the usefulness of our approach. For example, we identify some real events like ransomware outbreaks (55 users, 86 threads, December 2015, February 2016), the emergence of a black-market of decryption tools (34 users, 12 threads, February 2016), and romance scamming (82 users, 172 threads, March 2018). To maximize the impact of our work, we intend to: (a) develop a usable tool, (b) make the tool and our datasets publicly available. However, RecTen is a hierarchical clustering approach that can be used to take the pulse of large multimodal data and let the data reveal its own hidden structures.","Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social media, e.g., spanning po",Full Paper,P5,User Dynamics,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956772,static/pdfs/E1133_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18056,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34
E1135,On Positive Moderation Decisions,Mattia Samory,"A crucial role of moderators is to decide what content is allowed in their community. Though research has advanced its understanding of the content that moderators remove, such as spam and hateful messages, we know little about what moderators approve. This work analyzes moderator-approved content from 49 Reddit communities. It sheds light on the complexity of moderation by giving empirical evidence that the difference between approved and removed content is often subtle. In fact, approved content is more similar to removed content than it is to the remaining content in a community---i.e. content that has never been reviewed by a moderator---along dimensions of topicality, psycholinguistic categories, and toxicity. Building upon this observation, I quantify the implications for NLP systems aimed at supporting moderation decisions, which often conflate moderator-approved content with content that has potentially never been reviewed by a moderator. I show that these systems would remove over half of the content that moderators approved. I conclude with recommendations for building better tools for automated moderation, even when approved content is not available.","Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender",Full Paper,P6,Privacy and Moderation,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-08,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956773,static/pdfs/E1135_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18086,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
E1136,Online Communication Shifts in the Midst of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Case Study on Snapchat,Qi Yang|Weinan Wang|Lucas Pierce|Rajan Vaish|Xiaolin Shi|Neil Shah,"The Covid-19 pandemic has created large shifts in how people stay connected with each other in lieu of social distancing and isolation measures. More and more, individuals have turned to online communications as a necessary replacement for in-person interaction. Despite this, the research community has little understanding of how online communications have been influenced by the offline impacts of Covid-19. Our work touches upon this topic. Specifically, we study research questions around the impact of Covid-19 on online public and private sharing propensity, its influence on online communication homophily, and correlations between online communication and offline case severity in the United States. To do so, we study the usage patterns of 79 million US-based users on Snapchat, a large, leading mobile multimedia-driven social sharing platform. Our findings suggest that Covid-19 has increased propensity to privately communicate with friends, while decreasing propensity to publicly share content when users are out-and-about. Moreover, online communications have observed a marked decrease in baseline homophily across locations, ages and genders, with relative increases in cross-group communications. Finally, we observe that increased offline positive Covid-19 case severity in US states is associated with widening gaps between across-state and within-state communication increases after the onset of Covid-19, as well as marked declines in public sharing. We hope our findings drive further interest and work on online communication changes during pandemics and other extended times of crisis.","Psychological, personality-based and ethnographic studies of social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Social media usage on mobile devices|location, human mobility, and behavior|Organizational and group behavior mediated by soc",Full Paper,P16,Computation and Psychology,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-10,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956774,static/pdfs/E1136_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18107,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
E1145,Exercise? I thought you said 'Extra Fries’: Leveraging Sentence Demarcations and Multi-hop Attention for Meme Affect Analysis,Shraman Pramanick|Md Shad Akhtar|Tanmoy Chakraborty,"Today's Internet is awash in memes as they are humorous, satirical, or ironic which make people laugh. According to a survey, 33% of social media users in age bracket [13-35] send memes every day, whereas more than 50% send every week. Some of these memes spread rapidly within a very short time-frame, and their virality depends on the novelty of their (textual and visual) content. A few of them convey positive messages, such as funny or motivational quotes; while others are meant to mock/hurt someone's feelings through sarcastic or offensive messages. Despite the appealing nature of memes and their rapid emergence on social media, effective analysis of memes has not been adequately attempted to the extent it deserves. Recently, in SemEval'20, a pioneering attempt has been made in this direction by organizing a shared task on `Memotion Analysis' (meme emotion analysis). As expected, the competition attracted more than 500 participants with the final submission of [23-32] systems across three sub-tasks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the same set of tasks suggested in the SemEval'20 - Memotion Analysis competition. We propose a multi-hop attention-based deep neural network framework, called MHA-Meme, whose prime objective is to leverage the spatial-domain correspondence between the visual modality (an image) and various textual segments to extract fine-grained feature representations for classification. We evaluate MHA-Meme on the `Memotion Analysis' dataset for all three sub-tasks - sentiment classification, affect classification, and affect class quantification. Our comparative study shows state-of-the-art performances of MHA-Meme for all three tasks compared to the top systems that participated in the competition. Unlike all the baselines which perform inconsistently across all three tasks, MHA-Meme outperforms baselines in all the tasks on average. Moreover, we validate the generalization of MHA-Meme on another set of manually annotated test samples and observe it to be consistent. Finally, we establish the interpretability of MHA-Meme.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior",Full Paper,P9,Sentiment Analysis,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956775,static/pdfs/E1145_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18080,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

This paper undertakes a comparative computational analysis of bot activity during four recent elections in the Asia-Pacific. Through a systematic, multi-level comparison of bot activity, we contribute novel insights about shared and distinct computational features of the disinformation landscapes within a significant yet understudied geopolitical region. Across case studies in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan, we find non-negligible levels of bot activity: bots engage in higher levels of tweet production; interact with humans especially through mentions; tend to occupy denser and more isolated communities; use simpler and abusive language; and share partisan, irrelevant, or conspiratorial content.

Meanwhile, cannabis vaping has been associated with new lung diseases and rising adolescent use. To understand the impact of cannabis legalization on escalation, we design an observational study to estimate the causal effect of recreational cannabis legalization on the development of pro-cannabis attitude for e-cigarette users. We collect and analyze Twitter data which contains opinions about cannabis and JUUL, a very popular e-cigarette brand. We use weakly supervised learning for personal tweet filtering and classification for stance detection. We discover that recreational cannabis legalization policy has an effect on increased development of pro-cannabis attitudes for users already in favor of e-cigarettes.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification|Measuring predictability of real",Full Paper,P9,Sentiment Analysis,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956777,static/pdfs/E1150_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18037,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

Prior work has examined descriptions of people in English using contextual affective analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) technique that seeks to analyze how people are portrayed along dimensions of power, agency, and sentiment. Our work presents an extension of this methodology to multilingual settings, which is enabled by a new corpus that we collect and a new multilingual model. We additionally show how word connotations differ across languages and cultures, highlighting the difficulty of generalizing existing English datasets and methods. We then demonstrate the usefulness of our method by analyzing Wikipedia biography pages of members of the LGBT community across three languages: English, Russian, and Spanish. Our results show systematic differences in how the LGBT community is portrayed across languages, surfacing cultural differences in narratives and signs of social biases. Practically, this model can be used to identify Wikipedia articles for further manual analysis---articles that might contain content gaps or an imbalanced representation of particular social groups.","Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior",Full Paper,P9,Sentiment Analysis,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956778,static/pdfs/E1161_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18077,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

E1179,Imagine All the People: Characterizing Social Music Sharing on Reddit,Veniamin Veselovsky|Isaac Waller|Ashton Anderson,"Music shapes our individual and collective identities, and in turn is shaped by the social and cultural contexts it occurs in. Qualitative approaches to the study of music have uncovered rich connections between music and social context but are limited in scale, while computational approaches process large amounts of musical data but lack information on the social contexts music is embedded in. In this work, we develop a set of neural embedding methods to understand the social contexts of online music sharing, and apply them to a novel dataset containing 1.3M instances of music sharing in Reddit communities. We find that the patterns of how people share music in public are related to, but often differ from, how they listen to music in private. We cluster artists into social genres that are based entirely on aggregate sharing patterns and reflect where artists are invoked.  We also characterize the social and cultural contexts music is shared in by measuring associations with social dimensions such as age and political affiliation. Finally, we observe that a significant amount of sharing is attributable to extra-musical factors—additional meanings that people have associated with songs. We develop two methods to quantify the extra-musicality of music sharing. Our methodology is widely applicable to the study of online social contexts, and our results reveal novel cultural associations that contribute to a better understanding of the online music ecosystem.","Studies of digital humanities (culture, history, arts) using social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media",Full Paper,P11,Demographic (Dis)parities,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956780,static/pdfs/E1179_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18099,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
E1189,How Metaphors Impact Political Discourse: A Large-Scale Topic-Agnostic Study Using Neural Metaphor Detection,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran|Marek Rei|Ekaterina Shutova,"Metaphors are widely used in political rhetoric as an effective framing device. While the efficacy of specific metaphors such as the war metaphor in political discourse has been documented before, those studies often rely on small number of hand-coded instances of metaphor use. Larger-scale topic-agnostic studies are required to establish the general persuasiveness of metaphors as a device, and to shed light on the broader patterns that guide their persuasiveness. In this paper, we present a large-scale data-driven study of metaphors used in political discourse. We conduct this study on a publicly available dataset of over 85K posts made by 412 US politicians in their Facebook public pages, up until Feb 2017. Our contributions are threefold: we show evidence that metaphor use correlates with ideological leanings in complex ways that depend on concurrent political events such as winning or losing elections; we show that posts with metaphors elicit more engagement from their audience overall even after controlling for various socio-political factors such as gender and political party affiliation; and finally, we demonstrate that metaphoricity is indeed the reason for increased engagement of posts, through a fine-grained linguistic analysis of metaphorical vs. literal usages of 513 words across 70K posts.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification|Trend identification and tracking",Full Paper,P9,Sentiment Analysis,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-09,(16:45-17:45 GMT),38956781,static/pdfs/E1189_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18079,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

Under these circumstances, it is critical to understand the discussions surrounding these claims on Twitter, a major platform where the claims were disseminated. To this end, we collected and released the VoterFraud2020 dataset, a multi-modal dataset with 7.6M tweets and 25.6M retweets from 2.6M users related to voter fraud claims. To make this data immediately useful for a diverse set of research projects, we further enhance the data with cluster labels computed from the retweet graph, each user's suspension status, and the perceptual hashes of tweeted images. The dataset also includes aggregate data for all external links and YouTube videos that appear in the tweets.

Covering the entire 309 language editions and 33M articles, the dataset aims to track the full propagation history of Wikipedia concepts, and allow follow-up research on building predictive models of them. For this purpose, we align all the Wikipedia articles in a language-agnostic manner according to the concept they cover, which results in 13M propagation instances. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first to explore the full inter-language propagation at a large scale. Together with the dataset, a holistic overview of the propagation and key insights about the underlying structural factors are provided to aid future research. For example, we find that although long cascades are unusual, the propagation tends to continue further once it reaches more than four language editions. We also find that the size of language editions is associated with the speed of propagation. We believe the dataset not only contributes to the prior literature on Wikipedia growth but also enables new use cases such as edit recommendation for addressing knowledge gaps, detection of disinformation, and cultural relationship analysis.",Centrality/influence of social media publications and authors|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting|Measuring predictability of real world phenom,Dataset Paper,D1,Poster/Demo 1,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956794,static/pdfs/C1019_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18128,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

Unfortunately, alongside all this useful information, there was also a new blending of medical and political misinformation and disinformation, which gave rise to the first global infodemic. While fighting this infodemic is typically thought of in terms of factuality, the problem is much broader as malicious content includes not only fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories, but also promotion of fake cures, panic, racism, xenophobia, and mistrust in the authorities, among others. This is a complex problem that needs a holistic approach combining the perspectives of journalists, fact-checkers, policymakers, government entities, social media platforms, and society as a whole. With this in mind, we define an annotation schema and detailed annotation instructions that reflect these perspectives.

C1026,YouNiverse: Large-Scale Channel and Video Metadata from English-Speaking YouTube,Manoel Horta Ribeiro|Robert West,"YouTube plays a key role in entertaining and informing people around the globe. However, studying the platform is difficult due to the lack of randomly sampled data and of systematic ways to query the platform's colossal catalog. In this paper, we present YouNiverse, a large collection of channel and video metadata from English-language YouTube. YouNiverse comprises metadata from over 136k channels and 72.9M videos published between May 2005 and October 2019, as well as channel-level time-series data with weekly subscriber and view counts. Leveraging channel ranks from socialblade.com, an online service that provides information about YouTube, we are able to assess and enhance the representativeness of the sample of channels. Additionally, the dataset also contains a table specifying which videos a set of 449M anonymous users commented on.

C1035,CrisisBench: Benchmarking Crisis-related Social Media Datasets for Humanitarian Information Processing,Firoj Alam|Hassan Sajjad|Muhammad Imran|Ferda Ofli,"The time-critical analysis of social media streams is important for humanitarian organizations to plan rapid response during disasters. The crisis informatics research community has developed several techniques and systems to process and classify big crisis-related data posted on social media. However, due to the dispersed nature of the datasets used in the literature, it is not possible to compare the results and measure the progress made towards better models for crisis informatics. In this work, we attempt to bridge this gap by combining various existing crisis-related datasets. We consolidate eight annotated data sources and provide 166.1k and 141.5k tweets for informativeness and humanitarian classification tasks, respectively. The consolidation results in a larger dataset that affords the ability to train more sophisticated models. To that end, we provide binary and multiclass classification results using CNN, FastText, and transformer based models to address informativeness and humanitarian tasks, respectively.

C1041,A Dataset of State-Censored Tweets,Tuğrulcan Elmas|Rebekah Overdorf|Karl Aberer,"Many governments impose traditional censorship methods on social media platforms. Instead of removing it completely, many social media companies, including Twitter, only withhold the content from the requesting country. This makes such content still accessible outside of the censored region, allowing for an excellent setting in which to study government censorship on social media. We mine such content using the Internet Archive's Twitter Stream Grab. We release a dataset of 583,437 tweets by 155,715 users that were censored between 2012-2020 July. We also release 4,301 accounts that were censored in their entirety. Additionally, we release a set of 22,083,759 supplemental tweets made up of all tweets by users with at least one censored tweet as well as instances of other users retweeting the censored user. We provide an exploratory analysis of this dataset. Our dataset will not only aid in the study of government censorship but will also aid in studying hate speech detection and the effect of censorship on social media users.

C1052,HumAID: Human-Annotated Disaster Incidents Data from Twitter with Deep Learning Benchmarks,Firoj Alam|Umair Qazi|Muhammad Imran|Ferda Ofli,"Social networks are widely used for information consumption and dissemination, especially during time-critical events such as natural disasters. Despite its significantly large volume, social media content is often too noisy for direct use in any application. Therefore, it is important to filter, categorize, and concisely summarize the available content to facilitate effective consumption and decision-making. To address such issues automatic classification systems have been developed using supervised modeling approaches, thanks to the earlier efforts on creating labeled datasets. However, existing datasets are limited in different aspects (e.g., size, contains duplicates) and less suitable to support more advanced and data-hungry deep learning models. In this paper, we present a new large-scale dataset with ~77K human-labeled tweets, sampled from a pool of ~24 million tweets across 19 disaster events that happened between 2016 and 2019. Moreover, we propose a data collection and sampling pipeline, which is important for social media data sampling for human annotation. We report multiclass classification results using classic and deep learning (fastText and transformer) based models to set the ground for future studies.

In this paper, we introduce ABOME, a novel multi-platform data repository consisting of artificially boosted online media entities (also known as blackmarket-driven collusive entities), which are prevalent but often unnoticed in online media. ABOME allows quick querying of collusive entities across platforms. These include details of collusive entities involved in blackmarket services to gain artificially boosted appraisals in the form of likes, retweets, views, comments, follows and subscriptions. ABOME contains data related to tweets and users on Twitter, YouTube videos and YouTube channels. We believe that ABOME is a unique data repository which can be used as a benchmark to identify and analyze blackmarket-driven fraudulent activities in online media.

Using one week of data, we provide statistics regarding the numbers of tweets over time, the hashtags used, and the websites shared. We also illustrate how these data might be utilized by performing an analysis of the prevalence over time of high- and low-credibility sources, topic groups of hashtags, and geographical distributions. Additionally, we develop and present the CoVaxxy dashboard, allowing people to visualize the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine adoption and U.S. geo-located posts in our dataset.

Collecting Traveler-Centered Mobility Data via Crowdsourcing,Cristian Consonni|Silvia Basile|Matteo Manca|Ludovico Boratto|André Freitas|Tatiana Kovacikova|Ghadir Pourhashem|Yannick Cornet,"Mobility and transport, by their nature, involve crowds and require the coordination of multiple stakeholders - such as policy-makers, planners, transport operators, and the travelers themselves. However, traditional approaches have been focused on time savings, proposing to users solutions that include the shortest or fastest paths. We argue that this approach towards travel time value is not centered on a traveler's perspective. To date, very few works have mined data from crowds of travelers to test the efficacy and efficiency of novel mobility paradigms. In this paper, we build upon a different paradigm of worthwhile time in which travelers can use their travel time for other activities; we present a new dataset, which contains data about travelers and their journeys, collected from a dedicated mobile application. Each trip contains multi-faceted information: from the transport mode, through its evaluation, to the positive and negative experience factors. To showcase this new dataset's potential, we also present a use case, which compares corresponding trip legs with different transport modes, studying experience factors that negatively impact users using cycling and public transport as alternatives to cars. We conclude by discussing other application domains and research opportunities enabled by the dataset.","Engagement, motivations, incentives, and gamification.|Social media usage on mobile devices|location, human mobility, and behavior",Dataset Paper,D2,Poster/Demo 2,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956803,static/pdfs/C1064_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18119,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34

They contain over 6,000 online posts of user-generated content in English and/or Maltese, gathered from newswires and social networking services. These have been annotated for multiple opinion dimensions, namely subjectivity, sentiment polarity, emotion, sarcasm and irony, and in terms of negation, topic and language. These datasets are a valuable resource for developing Opinion Mining tools and Language Technologies, and can be used as a baseline for assessing the state-of-the-art and for developing new advanced analytical methods for Opinion Mining. Moreover, they can be used for policy formulation, policy-making, decision-making and decision-taking.

C1068,"Memes, Radicalisation, and the Promotion of Violence on Chan Sites",Blyth Crawford|Florence Keen|Guillermo Suarez-Tangil,"A number of violent far-right attacks in recent years have revealed an apparent connection with `chan culture', not just in the tangible examples of attackers uploading manifestos, final messages and livestreams to chan sites themselves, but in the widespread community support exhibited in some corners of this online subculture where violence is both trivialised and glorified. Commonly, this is manifested in the visual culture present on chan sites, particularly memes, which may be used to promote extreme or even violent narratives under the guise of humour and irony. 
 
 This paper seeks to understand how the visual culture of chan sites contribute to, and/or encourage violent discourse. In particular, we combine quantitative data scraping, ethnography and visual analysis across tens of chan sites ranging in popularity like 4chan, 8kun, or neinchan between March -- June 2020.

Because of this promise, the platform become popular among users who were suspended on mainstream social networks for violating their terms of service, as well as those fearing censorship. In particular, the service was endorsed by several conservative public figures, encouraging people to migrate from traditional social networks.

C1001,Studying Moral-based Differences in the Framing of Political Tweets,Markus Reiter-Haas|Simone Kopeinik|Elisabeth Lex,"In this paper, we study the moral framing of political content on Twitter. Specifically, we examine differences in moral framing in two datasets: (i) tweets from US-based politicians annotated with political affiliation and (ii) COVID-19 related tweets in German from followers of the leaders of the five major Austrian political parties. Our research is based on recent work that introduces an unsupervised approach to extract framing bias and intensity in news using a dictionary of moral virtues and vices. In this paper, we use a more extensive dictionary and adapt it to German-language tweets. Overall, in both datasets, we observe a moral framing that is congruent with the public perception of the political parties. In the US dataset, democrats have a tendency to frame tweets in terms of care, while loyalty is a characteristic frame for republicans. In the Austrian dataset, we find that the followers of the governing conservative party emphasize care, which is a key message and moral frame in the party's COVID-19 campaign slogan. Our work complements existing studies on moral framing in social media. Also, our empirical findings provide novel insights into moral-based framing on COVID-19 in Austria.","Psychological, personality-based and ethnographic studies of social media|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Text categorization|topic recognitio",Poster,D4,Poster/Demo 4,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956784,static/pdfs/C1001_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18135,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34

In this paper, we explore how learning approaches can be used toward the goal of classifying reasonability in personal retellings of events shared on social media. We collect 13,748 community-labeled posts from /r/AmITheAsshole, a subreddit in which Reddit users share retellings of personal events which are voted upon by community members. We build and evaluate a total of 21 machine learning models across seven types of models and three distinct feature sets. We find that our best-performing model can predict the reasonability of a post with an F1 score of .76. Our findings suggest that features derived from the post and author metadata were more predictive than simple linguistic features like the post sentiment and types of words used. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings as they relate to sharing retellings of personal events on social media and beyond.","Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, linguistic analyses of social media behavior|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena bas",Poster,D1,Poster/Demo 1,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956785,static/pdfs/C1013_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18133,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

 We find that on average the number of retweets received by users tends to increase over time.
 This is partly expected because users tend to gradually accumulate followers.
 Normalizing by the number of followers, however, reveals that the relative, per-follower retweet rate tends to be non-monotonic, maximized at a 'peak age' after which it does not increase, or even decreases.
 We develop a simple model of the process behind this phenomenon, which assumes a constantly growing number of followers, each of whom loses interest over time.
 We show that this model is sufficient to explain the non-monotonic nature of per-follower retweet rates, without any assumptions about the quality of content posted at different times.",Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Centrality/influence of social media publications and authors|Ranking/relevance of social media content and users|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery,Poster,D1,Poster/Demo 1,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-a,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956786,static/pdfs/C1021_highlight.pdf,Room A,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18131,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+A&spawnx=26&spawny=34

C1058,"American Politicians Diverge Systematically, Indian Politicians do so Chaotically: Text Embeddings as a Window into Party Polarization",Amar Budhiraja|Ankur Sharma|Rahul Agrawal|Monojit Choudhury|Joyojeet Pal,"Conversations on polarization are increasingly central to discussions of politics and society, but the schisms between parties and states can be hard to identify systematically in what politicians say. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of representation learning as a window into political dialogue on social media through the tweets authored by politicians on Twitter. We propose to embed politicians in a space such that their output embedding vectors represent the content similarity between the two politicians based on their tweets. We further propose a short-text based embedding technique to overcome some of the shortcomings of the previous methods. The learnt embeddings for politicians of India and the United States show two trends. First, that in the US case, we find a clear distinction between Democrats and Republicans, which is also reflected in the coalescing of the states that lean towards each party placing likewise in a graphical space. However, in the Indian case, the federal structure, multiparty system, and linguistic differences clearly manifest in the coalescing political discourse in the largely monolingual north and the scattered regional states. Our work shows ways in which machine learning methods can offer a window into thinking about how polarized political discourses manifest in what politicians say online.",Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media|Social network analysis|communities identification|expertise and authority discovery|Text categorization|topic recognition|demographic/gender/age identification|Measuring predictability of real wo,Poster,D3,Poster/Demo 3,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956789,static/pdfs/C1058_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18129,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
C1084,Well-Being Depends on Social Comparison: Hierarchical Models of Twitter Language Suggest That Richer Neighbors Make You Less Happy,Salvatore Giorgi|Sharath Chandra Guntuku|Johannes C. Eichstaedt|Claire Pajot|H. Andrew Schwartz|Lyle H. Ungar,"Psychological research has shown that subjective well-being is sensitive to social comparison effects; individuals report decreased happiness when their neighbors earn more than they do.
 In this work, we use Twitter language to estimate the well-being of users, and model both individual and neighborhood income using hierarchical modeling across counties in the United States (US). 
 We show that language-based estimates from a sample of 5.8 million Twitter users replicate results obtained from large-scale well-being surveys --- relatively richer neighbors leads to lower well-being, even when controlling for absolute income. 
 Furthermore, predicting individual-level happiness using hierarchical models (i.e., individuals within their communities) out-predicts standard baselines.
 We also explore language associated with relative income differences and find that individuals with lower income than their community tend to swear (f*ck, sh*t, b*tch), express anger (pissed, bullsh*t, wtf), hesitation (don't, anymore, idk, confused) and acts of social deviance (weed, blunt, drunk). 
 These results suggest that social comparison robustly affects reported well-being, and that Twitter language analyses can be used to both measure these effects and shed light on their underlying psychological dynamics.","Psychological, personality-based and ethnographic studies of social media|Qualitative and quantitative studies of social media",Poster,D4,Poster/Demo 4,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-d,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956790,static/pdfs/C1084_highlight.pdf,Room D,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18132,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+D&spawnx=26&spawny=34
C1003,SIGNLENS: A Tool for Analyzing People's Polarization Social Relationship Based on Signed Graph Modeling,Junjie Huang|Huawei Shen|Xueqi Cheng,"SIGNLENS is a tool that helps to analyze polarized social relationships based on signed graph modeling. 
It could be used by political analysts, historical researchers, and social media community organizations to analyze the social network with negative links (i.e., conflicts or disagreement). 
SIGNLENS can handle signed temporal graph by doing individual analysis and group analysis. 
Individual analysis gives a Web dashboard to users to explore the nodes who users focus on. 
Group analysis provides another perspective of analyzing the whole graph, which mainly analyzes the changes in the unbalance of the signed graph over time. 
We give two examples to demonstrate how our tool works, which consist of The China Biographical Database and the United States Congress Vote. 
More details about these two examples can be found in https://github.com/huangjunjie-cs/SIGNLENS.","Studies of digital humanities (culture, history, arts) using social media|Human computer interaction|social media tools|navigation and visualization|Subjectivity in textual data|sentiment analysis|polarity/opinion identification and extraction, lingu",Demonstration Paper,D3,Poster/Demo 3,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-c,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956791,static/pdfs/C1003_highlight.pdf,Room C,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18136,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+C&spawnx=26&spawny=34
C1060,ESG Tracker: Unbiased and Explainable ESG Profile from Real-time Data,Elaheh Momeni|Constantin Fraenkel|Patrick Kiss|Andreas Burgmann,"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company's operations that investors who are conscious about sustainability use to screen potential investments. Many sustainable investors use ESG criteria ratings provided by ESG rating providers, which are mainly based on corporate disclosures. However, the source of data and the diversity of their assessment methodologies have posed several challenges that lead to biased and non-transparent results. We propose a system that provides an unbiased ESG profile for companies from real-time data collected from the dynamic Web (online News and Social media platforms) that is explainable.",Ranking/relevance of social media content and users|Human computer interaction|social media tools|navigation and visualization|Trend identification and tracking|time series forecasting|Measuring predictability of real world phenomena based on social,Demonstration Paper,D2,Poster/Demo 2,https://icwsm-2021.slack.com/channels/room-b,2021-06-10,(14:15-15:15 GMT),38956792,static/pdfs/C1060_highlight.pdf,Room B,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18137,https://gather.town/app/InwIvgJ3kGcjFNss/icwsm-2021?map=Poster+Room+B&spawnx=26&spawny=34
