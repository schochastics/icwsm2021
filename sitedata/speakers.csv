Often, these discussions have focused on ways in which marginalized communities are under- and mis-represented in datasets, contributing to unintended consequences in algorithmic decision-making. In this talk, we argue that these challenges are only a part of a broader set of data inequalities. We present a framework encompassing data exclusion, inclusion, accuracy, usability, access, and ownership. Using examples in criminal justice, public service provisions, and health, we demonstrate ways in which processes in data generation, access, and use create and amplify harms in algorithmic decision-making. We conclude with a discussion on ways to combat these challenges using interventions drawing from a range of disciplines.","Rediet Abebe is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. Abebe holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University and graduate degrees in mathematics from Harvard University and the University of Cambridge. Abebe co-founded and co-organizes Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) and is serving as Program Co-chair for the inaugural ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO '21). Her dissertation received the 2020 ACM SIGKDD Dissertation Award and an honorable mention for the ACM SIGEcom Dissertation Award for offering the foundations of this emerging research area. Abebe's work has informed policy and practice at the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Ethiopian Ministry of Education, and numerous non-profit organizations. Abebe also co-founded Black in AI, a non-profit organization tackling equity issues in AI. Her research is influenced by her upbringing in her hometown of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",1

Platforms such as Amazon, Uber, Google, Facebook, Linkedin, YouTube, and Twitter effectively control access to a wide variety of information, services, and products. Surveillance systems, algorithmic filtering of information, bias, discrimination, social and political rankings of citizens are a few examples of challenges of the digital world. I will first focus on the structural level to discuss three digital governance problems that are worth highlighting, namely the multistakeholder nature of the Internet, the climate of growing global polarization and the rampant online misinformation. I will also discuss how computing research can stimulate the development of future policies and regulation for the digital world, with novel conceptions of governance using new technologies of distributed systems. This talk will suggest new opportunities to construct the future of digital governance, in a legitimate, inclusive, and secure use of digital resources to produce sustainable services and public policies for the online world.","Virgilio Almeida is a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). He is also Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University. Virgilio received his PhD degree in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, a Master's degree in computer science at PUC-Rio and a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from UFMG. He held visiting positions in several universities and research labs, such as Harvard University (School of Engineering and Applied Sciences), New York University, Boston University, Santa Fe Institute HP Labs. Professor Virgilio is the co-author of five books dealing Web technologies, e-commerce, performance modeling and capacity planning, published by Prentice Hall. His most recent book published by Palgrave MacMIllam is, "Governance for the Digital World." Virgilio was one of the commissioners of the Global Commission for the Stability of Cyberspace. His current research interests focus on social computing, governance of algorithms, modeling and analysis of large scale distributed systems.",2
